It was a convulsion which in the most extraordinary manner infuriated the human frame, and excited the astonishment of contemporaries for more than two centuries, since which time it has never reappeared. It was called the dance of St. John or of St. Vitus, on account of the Bacchantic leaps by which it was characterised, and which gave to those affected, whilst performing their wild dance, and screaming and foaming with fury, all the appearance of persons possessed.” Justus Friedrich Karl Hecker, The Black Death / The Dancing Mania Link This is a Level 1-12 5E adventure for an intrepid band of heroes. The player characters will confront a being from the Far Realm and it’s earthly agents in the form of a religious cult. This adventure follows the genre of heroic fantasy with a helping of dark fantasy elements and OSR sensibilities. The main inspiration for the adventure is the historical phenomenon of the Veitstanz, Dancing Mania, or St. Vitus Dance, an instance of collective mania that led people to uncontrollably move or dance to exhaustion in the 14th to the 17th century in different parts of Europe.1 An obligatory content warning: The adventure features themes of violence, injury, death, indoctrination, mind control and loss of agency, nightmares, drug use and addiction, body horror, and an infant demon.

Writing this adventure was a learning exercise for 5E rules and adventure design. Naturally, you will spot a lot of mistakes, bone-headed decisions, and quirks that are due to my own failings, lack of attention, or preferences. A Note on Railroading and Player Agency This is a linear adventure. If you like classic open-ended sandbox stuff, this might not be for you. I tried to add as much player agency and sandbox elements as possible, especially within specific nodes of the adventure, but there is an overall plot that unfolds and requires player buy-in. Even you you dislike this kidn of adventure design, maybe some sections can be used as stand-alone, location-based adventures. A Note on Balance Balance is tricky. For one, I have learned a lot from the OSR community about the joy that can be found in unbalanced encounters or, more precisely, a setting that contains a whole range of encounter types and it is up to the players to decide how to engage or disengage from dangerous situations. You see some of this thinking reflected in this adventure–some encounters are very deadly when players decide to go for a straight-up fight (those are signposted in the adventure). I have also become a fan of Morale rules from older editions of the dragon game, which can also be found as an optional rule in the DMG. I strongly suggest you use some version of morale to make your encounters more dynamic (see below 5E Rules). Within the confines of 5E rules and the CR system, I have found official guidelines to be fairly useless. I have played this adventures with two groups. One had four experienced and tactically skilled players, the other had eight novice players but competent PCs. Encounter balance varied wildly between the two groups and relative to the official encounter difficulty. The experienced group would regularly steamroll encounters–eventually I would simply throw encounters at them that were “balanced” for the 8-player group. All that is to say that encounter difficulty largely depends on your specific group. The monsters and encounters provided in the text were my baseline for providing my groups with different challenges. You will have to adjust as you see fit. 5E Rule Suggestions I generally like the 5E rule system, although, over time, there certainly were things that became a bit annoying. The two most difficult things to me were 1) providing interesting challenges to PCs with many versatile and near-limitless powers, and 2) avoiding dragging combat encounters because PCs and monsters have large HP pools. Here are the rule-changes and guidelines I used to keep the game to my liking: I tried hard to avoid adventuring days with only 1-2 encounters. Instead, I tried to follow a pattern of 3-4 hard to deadly encounters or otherwise resource-draining scenarios and two short rests per long rest. I made short rests ten minutes and kept Long Rests at eight hours, except when adventuring in specific environments (see, e.g., Into the Desert). If I were to run this again, I would just use the Gritty Realism and Slow Healing optional rules throughout. I recommend adopting the new Exhaustion rules from the OneDnD playtest. Don’t roll too much. Use backgrounds and skill proficiencies to determine baseline success. Only roll in situations were PCs are under pressure or risk of failure. Give information freely, let players describe their actions without defaulting to abilities on their character sheet. Make traps obvious, the challenge is disarming or circumventing them. "],["overview.html", "Chapter 1 Adventure Overview 1.1 Short Summary of the Main Conflict 1.2 Timeline of Events 1.3 Adventure Flowchart 1.4 Factions and Dramatis Personae 1.5 Additional Background Information", " Chapter 1 Adventure Overview This adventure thrusts a group of heroes in the role of adversaries to an alien evil and its earthly cult of followers. The heroes will encounter many classic tropes of rpg adventuring games: the exploration of the wilderness, delving into dungeons, fighting iconic monsters, investigating a series of murders, pulling off a heist, defending a city against a siege, devil’s bargains, and a final confrontation with an otherworldly threat. 1.1 Short Summary of the Main Conflict Andromalion is a being from the Far Realm, imprisoned on the Material Plane. They have spent several thousand years on this world in a never-ending sleep cycle. For 227 years, they sleep underground, dreaming of the Far Realm, only to emerge on Midsommer night of the 227th year to feast on human souls, wreaking destruction on the world around them. Andromalion is currently cocooned under the Northern city of Helsundburg. It is the year 226 of Andromalion’s sleep cycle and they are famished. The Church of Andromalion is a religious sect that reveres Andromalion as a god. Tempted by Andromalion via its dreams, they work to prepare the Midsommer feast. They plan to use the Sun-Harp, a magical musical instrument, and Andromalion’s Blessing, a magically-imbued drug, to force the whole population of Helsundburg into a dancing trance, allowing Andromalion to consume their souls in a moment of ecstasy. To the Church, dying on the day of Andromalion’s emergence is the way to salvation. The Church of Andromalion is led by the four the Pillars: Mencius Moravian—The Herald; Vraxa Redstar—The Guardian; Lady Linnea Halvermont—The Matron; Klausman Torfburg—The Steward. Under the leadership of Mencius, the Church is actively searching for five magical shards to construct the Sun-Harp, complete the research on Andromalion’s Blessing, produce sufficient quantities, and ship it to Helsundburg for the Midsommer festivities, and seize control of the city to assure a successful emergence of Andromalion. Besides the heroes, several other actors and factions are at cross-purposes with the Church of Andromalion: the Silversword family, the town of Bracken, the city of Helsundburg, the Helsundburg Merchant Bank, the dwarven Rumnaheim Society, the devil Paimoraxxas, and the Serpent-Lich Akuthla. 1.2 Timeline of Events At the beginning of the adventure, we are exactly one year away from Andromalion’s emergence from their slumber. The timeline of events without the heroes’ intervention is: Month Events July/August One shard is already in the possession of Mencius. One missing shard is being held by the goblin shaman Shargak, but Mencius has dispatched an agent to acquire the shard (see The Wayward Inn) and deliver it to him in the mining town of Bracken. Mencius is also using the Church’s influence over the Bracking Mining Corporation to establish access to a steady supply of Dream Dust from the Underdark, a necessary ingredient in the production of Andromalion’s Blessing (see Mining Trouble in Bracken). September The two remaining shards are in the possession of Benoit La Tour d’Auvergne in the city of Mersenne. Mencius will attempt to steal the missing shards from Benoit, possibly using the PCs as unwitting accomplices (see A Hired Hand). October In Helsundburg, Klausman Torfburg is planning to seize full control of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank to gain enough fiscal resources to support the mass production of Andromalion’s Blessing in Flowerdale. He is also using The House of the Red Door, a high-end drug den, to establish control over powerful members of high-society in Helsundburg (see Coin and Dagger). His right-hand man, Balthazar, is also responsible for a string of grisly murders in the city. October–May Lady Linnea is using her control over the Free County of Flowerdale to conduct her research into Andromalion’s Blessing, eventually producing three shiploads of the drug. The last shipment of the drug leaves for Helsundburg in May. November–January At some point during this time, Mencius learns of the location of the last remaining shard. He begins an expedition to the Underdark to find the Shrine of Jaelrynna and the last resting place of Torgga Wyrmstalker. April Shargak (or his second in command) is leading a goblin horde against the town of Bracken. June Vraxa Redstar, as the leader of the Order of the Crimson Heart, completes a coup in Helsundburg to sideline Gregor Silversword as the Sword of Justice and seize control of the law enforcement and defense of the city. Midsommar Mencius uses the traditional Midsommer celebrations in Helsundburg to prepare the city for the emergence of Andromalion. He poisons the freshwater supply of the city through the major aqueducts and uses the Sun-Harp on the central square to put the whole city into a dancing trance. During twilight, Andromalion emerges. They consume every living soul, including the members of the Church of Andromalion, flying off into the distance to burrow under another city and begin their next sleep cycle. 1.3 Adventure Flowchart Phase 1: The adventure begins with a linear portion in The Wayward Inn. Mining Trouble in Bracken is a mini-sandbox that gives PCs the chance to explore the mining town of Bracken and become more deeply involved in thwarting Mencius’ plans. Phase 2: After the PCs conclude the events in Mining Trouble in Bracken, they have several leads to pursue that lead to other mini-sandboxes, combined with linear plot developments: Travel to Mersenne and steal some mysterious magical shards (A Hired Hand). Travel to Helsundburg and investigate the Helsundburg Merchant Bank and a grisly string of murders (Coin and Dagger). Travel to Flowerdale in search of a shipment of dream dust (Flower Fields). Phase 3: Eventually, the PCs will have found additional clues that allow them to: Travel to the dwarven city of Rumna-Ur in search of a missing shard, pursued by Mencius himself Mountains of Madness. Make a deal with a devil for more information and travel to the desert in search of a banishment ritual Into the Desert. Sometime in Spring, the PCs face the choice to aid the city of Bracken in its defense against a Goblin horde under the leadership of Shazirr–an old enemy of the PCs Old Enemies. During the same time period, Vraxa Redstar will execute her coup attempt in Helsundburg and attack Benoit Silversword (Old Enemies). Phase 4: No matter what, in June Mencius will execute his plan and Andromalion will consume every single living soul in Helsundburg unless the PCs stop them Dreams of Andromalion. Figure 1.1: Adventure Flowchart 1.4 Factions and Dramatis Personae 1.4.1 The Church of Andromalion The Church has existed in many forms over the centuries. Ever since Andromalion has been exiled to the Material Plane, they have recruited mortals to their cause. The Church has had many names, e.g., the Ever Exalted Tree of Life, the Cult of the Morning Child, the Diagrammatic Church of Un, the Brotherhood of the Sanctified Blood, but has recurring features. First, the Church is always lead by four leaders, the so called Pillars, each fulfilling a specific role: The Herald leads the church and communes directly with Andromalion through dreams; The Guardian is the protector of the Church and its members, responsible for the security of the congregation; The Matron is the caretaker and healer of the Church; The Steward sees after the worldly resources of the Church. Historically, the Church has always been a small organization with few members. The Church tries to recruit among the upper class of any given society, especially individuals with deep-seated insecurities due to failed expectations of peers and their families, business and artistic failures, and perceived intellectual or physical shortcomings. It has been popular among second born children of leading families, the offspring of merchant houses, children of famed warriors and mages. Individuals with unusual physical deformities are particularly targeted by the Church and internally revered as blessed by Andromalion. The Church promises salvation and transformation through Andromalion towards the goal of physical, emotional, intellectual and artistic perfection. Under its joyful and harmless veneer, the Church is a vile organization that has refined its methods of predation and indoctrination over centuries. The rites and ceremonies of the Church always feature music (often the harp), singing, trance-like dancing, and outburst of joyful exultation. The highest holiday is Midsommar, in particular, the Holy Day of Emergence, every 227th year. The most important reliquary is the Sun-Harp, a magical instrument in the form of a wind chime consisting of five distinct glass shards. When sunlight hits the Sun-Harp, it generates a kaleidoscope of colors and music that The Herald uses in important ceremonies. The magical drug Andromalion’s Blessing, based on dried purple fungus from the Underdark and magically refined, is a holy sacrament to the Church. 1.4.1.1 Leaders of the Church Mencius (The Herald) A Warlock of Andromalion.

If anything, they are an existence reduced to a single emotion: desire. Having been cast out from the Far Realm, Andromalion has a singular wish, to again gaze upon the swirling maelstrom that is Azathoth, the Blind Idiot God, and revel in the atonal hymns of its continuous birth, death, and re-birth. Not much remains or ever existed beyond this one fixation. They have a faint memory of the times when they blissfully danced to the terrible tunes at the Blind Idiot God’s court. Then, suddenly, they were torn away and cast upon this world, blinded and disoriented, kept at an insurmountable distance from the maelstrom. Shackled to the material plane, imprisoned on this insignificant rock, it took them eons to find a way to hear Azathoth’s spherical music again—by using their dreams to travel the planes and temporarily return to Azathoth’s court. But dreams like these require power. Thus began the Cycle. For thousands of years, Andromalion spends 227 years in deep slumber, encased in a protective cocoon under the earth, dreaming their way to Azathoth’s court and exulting in their presence. Every 227 years, on midsummer night, they awaken, being pulled away from their reveling, filled with an insatiable hunger to replenish their reserves to return to their dream-state. The only satiation offered on this plane are human souls taken in a moment of blissful ecstasy. On midsummer night, they emerge from their cocoon to gorge themselves, only to return underground in a different part of the world to re-enter their dream-state. To prepare their feasting, Andromalion dreamed their way into the minds of some weak-willed mortals on the material plane, seducing them with promises of eternal joy, beauty, and physical transformation. Thus, the Church of Andromalion was born. A small religious organization, versions of which have emerged in different parts of the world throughout the ages, with the sole purpose of preparing for the eventual awaking of their false god. The Church’s prime focus is to use the Sun Harp, a magical instrument using shards of Andromalion’s carapace, and Andromalion’s Blessing, a magical drug derived from purple fungus growing near Andromalion’s cocoon in the Underdark, to put as many humans as possible into a ecstatic, trance-like state on the eve of Andromalion’s emergence. Dazed by the drug and the magical tunes of the Sun-Harp, the population begins to dance until death and their souls can be consumed by Andromalion. The music of the Sun-Harp also has a secondary purpose. After its slumber, Andromalion awakens weakened and confused. The music of the Sun-Harp helps it to regain focus and strength, facilitating the mass consumption of souls and destruction of the city. This cycle has been repeated for thousands of years, often ending in calamity for the city close to Andromalion’s resting place. Always, the Church re-emerges and recruits individuals to its cause. The last time the cycle culminated in the awakening of Andromalion near the Northern city of Helsundburg, the Pearl of the North. A group of heroes, led by Edward Silversword, thwarted the Church’s plan, forcing Andromalion to prematurely return to its slumber, weakened and only partially fed. The heroes also captured the Sun-Harp and broke it into pieces, hiding the parts to hamper any future efforts by the Church to aid Andromalion. Only partially satiated, Andromalion remained in Helsundburg, again burrowed deep under it. Official town records do not mention the emergence of Andromalion, only the occurrence of an earthquake. Andromalion has spent the last 226 years in their dream-state to re-build the Church and ensure revenge on the family that resisted its desire to feast. The adventure begins exactly one year from the emergence of Andromalion. Andromalion has recruited four individuals to lead the new Church of Andromalion (see Dramatis Personae): Mencius (The Herald), Vraxa Redstar (The Guardian), Lady Linnea Halvermont (The Matron), Klausman Torfburg (The Steward). At the beginning of the adventure Mencius has acquired two of the five shards needed to reconstruct the Sun-Harp. He has plans in motion to: Acquire the three missing shards. Produce the necessary quantities of Andromalion’s Blessing to poison the whole city of Helsundburg during the Midsommer festivities.

Apply whatever hexcrawl exploration rules you favor. For 24 mile hexes, I typically allow a party of PCs to move one hex per day (two on trade roads) or explore a single hex for hidden features. If you aren’t into hexcrawling and exploration, handwave travel and just jump to the linear parts of the action. If you want more of an exploration feel in your campaign, PCs should track their resources. Each PC needs to consume one unit of rations and water to stay healthy. Water can be carried or found with a successful Survival check. Failing to consume rations and water incurs increasing levels of Exhaustion after the first full day (using OneDnD playtest Exhaustion rules). Roll for a random wilderness encounters twice per day. 1D8 EVENT 1. Encounter 2. Omen 3. A shift in weather 4. Loss of a resources (e.g., rations or other gear) 5.

The players happen to find themselves, for various reasons, in the Wayward Inn for a night of rest on their individual journeys. Late in the night, a wounded stranger enters the Inn and collapses. The players have to safe the stranger and begin to unravel the mystery surrounding the injured ranger, who is carrying valuables and a mysterious glass shard. A hunting party of Goblins are approaching the Inn and are determined to catch the stranger and his loot. The players have to defend the Inn against two waves of assault and then organize a flight of the patrons and staff to the nearby mining town of Bracken in the middle of a third wave of attack. En route to Bracken, the players have to fend off a final attack by the hunting party and make it to safe haven. At the same time, the players have to deal with a group of NPCs in the Inn that will pose their own danger, trying to acquire some of the valuables of the stranger, as well as the underlying machinations of the agent of the Church of Andromalion–whose goal it is to acquire the glass shard and kill the stranger. Major events: Safe the stranger Defend the Inn 2x Stop the Hjalford Gang Flee the Inn Reach Bracken 3.2 The Setup I think it is easiest of players come up with their own reason for having formed an adventuring party. I mostly assume they are familiar with each other and are traveling towards the town of Bracken. Here are some possible hooks for the party: A druid circle has discovered some water contamination in a river that flows from the mountains near Bracken into the nearby Tallwood, poisoning animals and plants alike. A senior druid asked them to travel to Bracken and find the source of the problem. PCs may have been hired by a thieves’ guild to deliver a coded message to a contact in Bracken (likely Renard). The PCs may have just finished a job escorting some prospectors in the area and are arriving at the Wayward Inn for some well earned rest and respite after a long time in the wilderness. A PC with a crafting background was asked to deliver guild papers to the blacksmith in Bracken. The PCs arrive after a long day of travel at the Wayward Inn. Give the PC time to arrive, take in the surroundings, and settle in. They should have the chance to meet the staff and patrons of the Wayward Inn and engage in some social interactions until the Stranger appears. 3.2.1 The Wayward Inn The Wayward Inn is a regionally known establishment to the East of the larger town of Rumnahold. The Inn sits at the crossroads of the road to the mining town Bracken (2 hours travel at normal pace with a wagon, 1 hour on a horse), roads to other mountain towns, and the road to Rumnahold. It is not far from the Tallwood–a dense and wild forest rumored to harbor Orcs, Goblins, and brigands. The Wayward Inn is known for its reliable stable and associated services, hearty stews, and fair prices. A lot of commercial traffic comes through from the more remote mining towns to Rumnahold. The road to Bracken is patrolled by the Bracken Mining Corporation guard force. The Inn has a large common room at ground-level, a cellar for provisions, an upstairs with four private rooms, and one shared sleeping room. The Inn also has stables (with room for six horses, 4 stalls occupied), and a barn (with a cart). Figure 3.1: Wayward Inn Ground Floor. Source: Dyson Logos Figure 3.2: Wayward Upstairs.

They are posing as a traveling merchant of salves and potions with his two guards. Alosius Mendaban–Scholar and gem expert. Traveling back from Bracken on his way to Rumnahold. Aloof and snobby. Tall, thin, nicely coiffed hair and trimmed beard. High-quality traveler’s robe. An expert in gems, uses that to finance is scholastic endeavors. Visited Bracken to assess the quality of some gems. Sits by himself, drinks a bit of wine, nibbles cheese and is reading a tome. Stats of a Commoner but high intelligence and proficiency in lore, history, gems, religion. Skilled gem artificer. Will try to acquire the gem of the Stranger without revealing its value. 3.2.3 Activities Players can: Talk with the Hjalford Gang Talk with the Staff Drink with Boren -Try to interact with Alosius Listen to Cilian mess up some songs. Order food (Today’s stew, cheese, cured meats, bread, wine, ale, spirits, honeyed oatmeal, boiled eggs, smoked fish) 3.3 The Stranger in the Night The atmosphere in the Inn is very cozy and nice, everyone seems to be enjoying the talking, eating, and interacting (even Alosius). The weather outside is a bit stormy, rain is about to start. Falf will ask the patrons to engage in a card game. The game is 19 Fingers. Similar to blackjack. Goal is to get as close as possible to 19 but not over. Every players gets a private D10 rolled (value of their first card). Second private D10 (value of their second card). Two 10s count as 19\\(+\\) and are the best possible roll. Then betting starts. First entry bet (5 SP). Falf will start with 2 GP. Players can attempt Sleight of Hand against the passive perception of the table. They can change one of their die rolls. Second round of betting. Third D10 roll is public. Before the third roll is revealed–BAM–the main door suddenly bursts open, a stranger staggers into the room. Everyone is shocked, the singing stops, the stranger walks in, the door keeps clanging due to the wind, and after a few feet, the stranger collapses–an arrow sticking our of his back. 3.3.1 The Stranger The Stranger is at zero hit points and poisoned. Players will have to stabilize him to stop him from dying (DC 10 Medicine). Or use spell or other healing ability. After healing, the stranger will wake briefly and mumble: ``..have to get away…they are after me..’’ and looses consciousness again. The poison is vicious and can’t be cured easily by the players. It will make the Stranger worse throughout the night. Hjort, if called upon, will proffer a tincture, but it won’t do anything. Things to observe and note about the Stranger: A large gem–Alexandrite, transparent dark green, worth 500 GP, needs a hard DC 20 Intelligence check to identify. Alosius will immediately see it’s worth, a passive perception check for Alosius, roll D20+2, compare to players’ passive perceptionto see if anyone spots his reaction. Hjort will also immediately spot its worth. Short sword Dagger Empty vial with some blueish liquid (haste and endurance potion)–Medicine/Arcana DC10 check. Satchel Rugged but high-quality leather armor Some bread 23 gold coins Rope Map (of the area around Olmen Hill, 3.5 days march from here) Glass shard with markings. This is one of the five glass shards that make up the Sun-Harp that Mencius us trying to assemble. The outward appearance is that of an odd bauble of little value, especially in contrast the Alexandrite gem. A Perception DC-12 check reveals that the light catches and refracts in it interestingly, quite mesmerizing to look at. Detect magic reveals a faint magical aura. Whoever is in possession of the shard might receive dream messages from Andromalion conferring banes or boons on them. E.g., Shargak was able to use the shard to amplify his mind and emotion control magic to unify warring goblin tribes. Any benefit comes at the cost of sublt influence from Andromalion. A tattered note with instructions: Deliver to the Wayward Inn. Ask for the reserved single room. Contact will approach. Code word ``Heavenly Reward’’, Signed, M. Room was reserved via letter from a courier, Adalbert Toyne, from Bracken. Investigation DC-12: Must have traveled/run a far distance, good but worn clothes, vials suggest some kind of endurance potion. The arrow: Shortbow arrow, with a coating. Intelligence or Nature DC-12 check reveals it to be Goblin-made. Intelligence-14 check reveals information on Goblins (slavers, vicious, only attack in numbers, sometimes band together with Bugbears, use rats and wolfs, if it’s a raiding party, they may be coming, especially if the Stranger stole something from the Goblins.) Raiding parties have groups of scouts, and then a main attack force. Can range in size from 20-60 goblins. Let the players determine their course of action. Do they want to secure the inn? Block the doors? Hide in the cellar? Do they also want to secure the stables? Do they want to scout the area (no immediate sign of Goblins, but Stranger did not come from the road)? 3.4 The Attack NOTE: Shargak’s war party is under the influence of his spells and potions. Goblins and Hobgoblins appear emaciated, a bit sickly, and extra manic. The use of the shard has generated these effects. Attack Wave 1: 1 Goblin Boss (MM) 4 Goblins (MM) 2 Wolfs (MM) If the players take position outside, they can try to spot the Goblins approach. Fight outside. If the players barricade inside, Goblins will try to break down the door. Roll a Strength or Athletics against the goblins (PC receive advantage). If they can’t get in the door, they’ll try to get in the back and climb on top and enter via the roof. Attack Wave 2: This is a substantial part of the hunting party. There are three attack teams. Team 1: 2 Hobgoblins (MM), 2 Goblins (MM). Team 1 will attack the Inn when players leave to save the horses. Team 2: 1 Bugbear (MM) and 2 Goblins (MM). Team 2 will attack the stables to kill the horses. They will kill the Stable Master unless the players intervene. Only two horses survive. Players need to get out to save the horses. Team 3: 4 Goblins using their shortbows. Team 3 covers any outside area with arrows from the treeline (half-cover). The goblins scream about Shargak during their attack. If the second wave goes badly, one option could be the capture of the players. The Maid will kill the Stranger, abscond with the shard and leave the players for capture. This will lead to an escape sub-adventure. The Goblins will try to enslave the characters. They’ll have to plot an escape. The goblins will bring them to a cage on a wagon and transport towards a slaving trading post. 3.5 Flight! After the second wave, there is a period of calm. Players can tend to their wounds and wounds of others. Players may want to organize a flight to Bracken, because: They have discerned another attack is coming, led by the leader of the Goblins Shargak. The Stranger is getting worse and needs more medical attention. The surviving staff and patrons want to flee for safety. The players should make a plan for escape. Need to convince Alosius and the staff to leave some things behind. Need to load the cart, get horses/donkey. At some point on the way, the group will hear wolf howling to unsettle them. A large bird is following them (+6 D20 stealth roll against passive Perception DC of each player unless they are actively looking, then it’s a Perception DC-16). They may be able to shoot it down (ranged attack AC 16). Further down the road, a fallen tree blocks passage. PCs need to find a way to remove the tree trunk (group Athletics check DC-14). During that attempt the Hjalford Gang will attack to kill everyone and grab the Alexandrite gem. They will try to take the Maid as a hostage and then take the bag with the gem and the horses to get away. 3.5.1 The Hjalford Gang Members: Hjort Hjalford: older, big belly, balding, grey face, leader of the group, strategist, proficient with a mace, calculating and brutal, poses as a merchant, stats: Hired Thug (MM). Halgir: nephew of Hjort, tall, muscular, the fighter and muscle, has an explosive that will go off close to the horses), stats-wise a Thug (MM). Falf: lanky, long black hair, throwing knives and crossbow, rogue-like, smells a bit, handsy with women. Stats of a Spy (MM). If the Hjalford Gang is successful, they abscond with the gem, shard, and the Maid as a hostage, only to be found later murdered and without the bag. If the gang is unsuccessful, the horses might still get away. Figure 3.3: Hjalford Gang Ambush. Source: Homemade 3.5.2 Shargak’s Attack Further down the road, Shargak will ambush the PCs. Shargak will step out of the forest and block the road. Threaten enslavement and commands his troops to claim his shard. The Ogre and wolves will come out of the forest behind the group. Shargak’s attack: Shargak– Goblin Shaman. Adjust stats to: HP 18, +4 spellcasting, no necrotic damage on staff, only 1d6 for staff. Treasure: potion of firebreath, 45 GP. 3 Goblins (MM). 1 Ogre (MM) If the attack becomes too difficult, guards from Bracken arrive and will try to save the group. Shargak will surrender to survive. When opportune, the Maid will strike, kill the stranger, and abscond with the shard during Shargak’s attack. Players are left with a reduced group and without horses. Don’t railroad this. The Maid will try to steal the shard and get away, but if the players prevent that–so be it. Shargak may die here, flee, or be captured. Figure 3.4: Shargak’s Attack. Source: Homemade 3.6 Safe Haven The group arrives in Bracken and is rewarded for saving the staff and guests of the Inn. A representative of the Bracken Mining Corporation rewards the players with 50 GP each. 3.7 Conclusion Next stop: Bracken. The PCs get to explore the town and take on new challenges. Open questions: What is the shard? Who wants it? Who is M.? Where is the maid? The gem. If the players acquire the gem, it could be sold or they could donate the gem/proceeds to the Wayward Inn people. Alosius will give a good price. PCs should advance to Level 2 after concluding the opening chapter.

They can pursue some leads with regard to the mysterious M. Eventually, their efforts will run into a wall. Godefrey Bast (BMC) hires the players to kill a monster and then escort a shipment of telerium and dream dust. BMC hires players to break up the strike, i.e., convince the dwarf leader to send their men back to work. Dwarfs may convince the players to help them. Players investigate the mine: discover telerium mining area, confront a group of duergar. PCs need to storm the BMC head office to acquire essential documents of the activities to help the Rumnaheim Society. Doing so, they find Godefrey’s journal, discover M.’s involvement, M. is a representative of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. M. suggested establishing contact with the Duergar to begin telerium mining and to acquire a glass shard from them, in exchange they would supply them with surface resources, weapons, and information. 4.2 Arriving in Bracken Players are able to take in the town for the first time in the light of the morning. Bracken has the feel of a frontier town–a little rough and tumble with a wild and chaotic atmosphere. The town is quite busy during the day and early evening. Buildings are mostly new, build with a good level of craftsmanship, few made of stone, most of timber. The town is clearly booming. Lots of new people are arriving, walking in the streets, seeking opportunity. The town’s population consits mostly of humans and dwarves. Many miners, coachmen, porters, and skilled craftsmen, but also teams of loggers that use the town as a base for logging treks. The town has maybe a total population of 600ish permanent residents but there are a lot of transients. Like many frontier settlements, the population is younger and male. You don’t see too many children or old people. The streets are patrolled by guards of the Bracken Mining Corporation, but you can see lots of weapons being carried by everyday folk. This clearly is a place were scuffles and fights are an everyday occurrence. You could see this being an attractive destination for someone trying to make their way or forget their past. Figure 4.1: The Town of Bracken. Source: Made with Watabou City Generator Major areas of the town and points of interest: 1 Trade Quarter The Bracken Inn and Tavern–good-quality inn Torin’s General Goods Store Fine Metalwork–Armor and Weapons 4-5 additional smiths, mostly focused on tools Several artisans Trading offices A doctor’s practice A temple to a god of craftsmanship or commerce Courier’s Office 2 Bracken Mining Corporation Headquarters Main Office Warehouse Barracks 3 Dwarven Quarter Temple of Moradin Dwarven armorer Rumnaheim Society House (drinking room, back room, office) The Well — simple Dwarven tavern. 4 The Toil–Worker’s Quarter The Corner House–low-quality inn, workers stay here first Renard’s–tavern and brothel Stuff to do in Bracken: Buying/selling items Healing/resting Carousing Getting in a fight Gambling at Renard’s Looking for gossip and information: 1D10 RUMOR OR INFORMATION 1 One of the girls at Renard’s has a disease (false) 2 The BMC is a godsend and made this town what it is. There are lots of jobs available: miners, engineers, cooks, loggers. If you want to make something of yourself, hire on with the BMC! 3 The town is attracting a lot of newcomers and they are putting strain on the community. Maybe we should kick some of them out–looks at PC. 4 The BMC is the big dog in town, but there are some other merchants and tradespeople starting to set up shop in town. 5 Everyone is wearing weapons because it’s a somewhat dangerous place: mines are dangerous, forest is dangerous, mountains are dangerous, the city is dangerous. The BMC is keeping the peace in most of the city. Dwarfs are keeping the peace in their quarter (the safest one). 6 A few months ago there was a cave-in and some noxious gas was released. That area of the mine is now closed. (true) 7 The dwarfs are starting to complain too much–if they don’t like it here, they should go back to Rumnahold! (Said by a human) 8 This town is full of vagrants and crime is soaring. The BMC is not doing enough to keep order. (Said by a dwarf). 9 Godefrey Bast controlling all criminal activity in Bracken (partially true). 10 The Rumnaheim Society has opened a chapter and is spreading its influence. Their sigil is a pick axe and a war axe over a shield. They are here to help the dwarfs take over! (partially true). 4.3 Investigating M. The PC may want to pursue the identity of M. based on the note they recovered from the Stranger’s body. Leads: The Courier Service They can go and talk to the courier’s office. They’ll have to the convince the clerk to check the logbook. Turns out, no record of the client’s name was kept, but the clerk’s initials are visible: ``O.T.’’ A different clerk took in the order. Find the clerk Orwin Teller. They’ll have to track him down in the Toils. He likes to visit Renard’s. Orwin can offer a description of the client (Intimidation/Persuasion DC-16): Looked human, male, hard to guess the age, long blonde hair, fine clothes, probably a merchant. Further prodding reveals the client had a birthmark on his wrist, covered by a glove. Characters with the Charlatan background can guess it is a disguise. Birthmark may be a misdirect. Lynn the Maid The PCs migth ask around in town about Lynn. A pretty girl with red hair would stick out and, in fact, they can get pointed to Renard’s. Renard and his bartenders won’t say anything. The sex workers in the establishment will reveal some information if sufficiently compensated or convinced. This much can be gleaned from the staff and patrons: Lynn worked the bar at Renard’s. She hasn’t been there in over 6 months though. She was not an inexperienced woman, could defend herself. She would sometimes chat with a man that had a birthmark on his wrist outside of Renard’s. It’s unlikely the PCs will gather enough actionable information about M. at this stage to identofy him. They may ask around the Trade Quarter with Mencius’ description, but that won’t get them far. There are simply too many traveling merchants that come to town. Mencius has also been careful to disguise himself at times when doing business in Bracken. If Lynn successfully stole the shard during the flight from the Wayward Inn, she immediately brought it to Mencius, who killed her and stored her body in a box in his office. Mencius has a small office in the Trade Quarter as an agent of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. 4.4 The Execution of Shargak If Shargak surrendered to the PCs and they took him prisoner, the BMC will announce his planned execution in a few days time (big event!). PCs may want to visit Shargak in the cells of the BMC barracks. This might be a goo dopportunity to learn more about the BMC and its role in Bracken. They will have to approach through the main gate and be escorted to the cell. They’ll have to convince the guards or an officer to gain access to Shargak. The only prisoners in the cells are Shargak and a humn that accidentally killed someone in a bar brawl. Shargak is not willing to say much, but he will eventually reveal that he was drawn to the shard and does not feel the shard anymore. He does not know if that is because the shard is gone or because of something else. He is to be executed in 2 days. Perception DC-17: he has a bunch of dead rats stuffed into his straw mattress. The rat carcasses are material ingredients for a spell he is preparing to aid his flight during the execution. The other prisoner is Born Lagerfell. He looks unwell. Won’t talk. The day of the execution: Brisk sunny day. Execution is meant to happen at noon. Townsfolk congregate in the main square, a small platform has been erected. Sausages and meat pies are being sold. 1st execution is Born Lagerfell, convicted of manslaughter. For Shargak’s execution, an eagle will be circling. Right before the execution, Born rises from the dead as a Zombie (MM). Shargak will transform himself into 13 rats and disperse. Only one of the rats carries his consciousness. He will either try to scurry away into a dark hole or be picked up by the eagle. Be reasonable. Shargak is clever nad will do his best to get away, but if the PCs are on top of things or get lucky, then Shargak’s story ends here. 4.5 Working for the BMC The PCs might take on some jobs through the BMC that’ll send them outside of Bracken. This is the chance for a little wilderness exploration. Here are some very simple hexcrawl rules: Each hex is six miles. For each day, the PCs have four travel actions (6 hours each): Move to another hex. Explore current hex. Reveals a hidden local sight (roll Survival DC-12). Long Rest takes two travel actions. 12 hours are needed to prepare a camp, supplies, and dealing with environmental hazards. Each day without a *Long Rest incurss 1 level of exhaustion. Every other travel action, roll for an Encounter. 1D8 EVENT 1. Encounter 2. Omen 3. A shift in weather 4. Loss of a resources (e.g., rations or other gear) 5. Gain 1 level of Exhaustion due to weather exposure 6-8 Nothing happens. If you roll for an encounter, use the appropriate random encounter tables from Xanathar’s, based on the hex terrain type. When encountering creatures, make sure to do an old-school Reaction Roll for the monster. 2D6 Monster/NPC reaction 2 Hostile, attacks 3-5 Unfriendly, may attack 6-8 Neutral, uncertain 9-11 Indifferent, uninterested 12 Friendly, helpful Figure 4.2: The Town of Bracken and Surroundings.

He wants to hire them for a task. His men are busy with keeping peace in town, guarding the mine, patrolling the road and they are not all of the highest quality. Given how the PCs handled the attack on the Wayward Inn, the head of the BMC, Godefrey Bast, thinks they are right for the job. A few miners were hoping to explore some caves nearby, maybe a days march from Bracken. At night, they were attacked. One miner was killed, dragged towards the caves. Reward is 30 GP per person. Talking to the miners: Martin, Oden, Trip went to explore some caves. Built a campsite not too far from the caves (Hex 0202). They got attacked at night. Trip was killed. Couldn’t really see much. A large creature, slithering on the ground. Oden will not go, but Martin can show the players the location. If the PCs are asking around for wilderness expertise or people that might know more about local monsters, sooner or later they’ll be referred to the dwarven ranger/beastmaster Osswald the Long, who patronizes the dwarven tavern The Well when in town. He has a huge red beard, braided in a multitude of ways, sunburnt, huge crossbow, and a warpick. He can give them tips on the area (and help them if the fight goes badly). He is eating a huge bowl of oatmeal, throwing carrots to his animal companion Fred the Goat (seems very unfriendly, has demonic eyes, stats of a Giant Goat (MM) with the ability to shoot a firebolt cantrip out of its eyes). He is scheduled to escort some loggers, already late by a day because the ladies at Renard’s requested him to stay.

Nature DC-15 check reveals the possibility of a Grick. Creature info: dwells in caves, resistance against bludgeoning, slashing, piercing, attacks with tentacles, beak, tail. Hard to spot in rocky terrain. Gricks live in nests with Alpha Gricks. Up to the players how to deal with this. Maybe they go right after it, maybe they want to lay a trap and lure the monster out. Maybe they want to hire Osswald to help. The Grick Cave houses 2 regular Gricks (MM) and 1 Grick Alpha (MM). This fight can easily TPK the party if they aren’t smart about it. Make sure to foreshadow the danger. The cave has valuables worth 27 GP. Figure 4.3: Campsite. Source: Homemade Figure 4.4: Grick Lair. Source: Homemade 4.5.2 Escort Mission Tolliver approaches the group for another task. This one requires some discretion. PCs are meant to escort a cart from the BMC HQ to a way point 2 days West of the Wayward Inn (Hex 0106). Keep your hands of the cargo and keep your mouths shut. You will meet your hand-off crew at a crooked tree, a turn off the main road at sundown two days after tomorrow. The contact will have a code phrase for you: ``The price of saltpeter is unusually high in Rumnahold. Reward: 20 GP each. PCs can try to investigate the cargo but the driver (Willem, human, fat, balding, buggy eyes, crooked smile) will warn them off. If they can distract him or investigate secretly, they will discover four large metal lock boxes, each very heavy. Lockpicking DC-18 to open. Inside the three boxes are packages of wax paper wrapped, shiny metal ore pieces. Alchemy/metal work DC-22 check to identify the metal telerium. If players touch the metal, they’ll receive a blighted status for 3 days with hit points lowered by 3 and 2 levels of Exhaustion. The last box contains two sacks/ two pounds of purple dust / dream dust. It’s a drug won from fungi grown typically in the Underdark. Causes ecstatic dream-state. Nature-21 DC to identfy or familiarity with criminal enterprises. The trip itself is uneventful. The hand-off: A group of 6 riders approaches. They have leather armor, hoods drawn over their heads. The leader is a human. Group is a mix of humans, Half-Orcs, and dwarfs. All of them of visible tattoos. The leader does not give the code phrase right away. She asks if they have checked the cargo. Warns them again to keep their mouths shut and not talk about it. Get’s a bit confrontational. Any character with a criminal background or from Rumnahold can do a History DC-17 check, to place the colors and tattoos. They are part of the Blooded Hand, a criminal organization in Rumnahold and along the Northern coast. They are mostly engaged in smuggling. As the meeting is ending, the group can make a Perception-18 check (plus dim light). They hear a branch crack and see some movement in some brush. They can go investigate and capture a young female dwarf (Kilia) that observed the exchange. She is from Bracken, loves to roam the countryside. She plans to become a ranger. She accidentally stumbled onto this meeting and got curious. Willem is concerned and says players were lucky that the contact didn’t see the kid. He suggests murdering the kid. Players need to Intimidate/Persuade Willem not to kill the kid (DC-20) or kill Willem (or find another solution). Intimidating/Persuading the kid is not hard DC-10. This mission should clue in the PCs that he BMC is a ruthless organization and likely involved in some shady business. 4.5.3 Breaking the Strike A messenger tells PCs to meet Tolliver at the BMC HQ. He meets them in the yard and escorts them to the office of Godefrey. Godefrey is a human, mid-40s, muscular build, short-cropped hair, wears leather armor, weathered face. He tells the players how impressed he is with their services. He could use their help with a delicate task: The BMC has done a lot to put Bracken on the map. For four years we have poured resources into the town and slowly turned this into an increasingly successful venture. Providing good jobs for miners and prosperity for the town! We maintains the roads, offer security. We have plans to attract more families. This all rests on the support of the whole community. The BMC has done well running this town and making sure both humans and dwarven miners work together. This operation depends on the dwarven miners and engineers–there is a contract that spells out some rules (profit sharing, wages, expansion plans, no strikes, etc). This is delicate business. Sadly, we have had increasingly problems with the dwarven miners, especially since the Rumnaheim society has opened their chapter. The Rumnaheim society is agitating to break the agreement and take over the mine and possibly the town, expelling all humans. BMC can’t have that or any delays in our operations. The dwarfs need to be brought to reason. He has heard rumors of an impending strike. This is unacceptable. No more work delays and especially no strike. I figure, if you take out the ring leaders, this will put a stop to things. Time is of the essence. I think the dwarves will strike within the next 5 days, when a big ore shipment is due. My reward is 100 GP per person if you solve this problem. Pressure the ring leaders into submission or remove them from the equation… If the PCs resist the idea, he ups the reward to 150 GP per person. If the PCs still resist, he pressures them. Tells them that the shipment they escorted contained illegal substances. He has sworn witness testimony and testimony from a member of the Blooded Hand that he will release to Helsundburg authorities that will make them hunted across the North, with a substantial bounty on their head. Trouble maker 1: Falin Thurbrook, dwarven engineer, 133 years old. Experienced and well-respected mining engineer. Trouble maker 2: Orin Stoutale, A cleric of the Rumnaheim Society. Use stats of a Priest (MM) First step: investigate Falin: is a trusted leader, has been here from the beginning, senior engineer at the BMC. Not been seen in public the last few days. Has two sons. Both are also mining engineers. One has a family. The other does not and likes to gamble. Orin/Rumnaheim Society: arrived a few months ago, older dwarf, white beard, friendly eyes, dwarfs will say (DC-14) that the Rumnaheim Society is like a union. It is trying to lobby for better working conditions and provide help to dwarfs and their families. it advocates for a dwarven lifestyle. With a DC-19 check they can leanr that the Rumnaheim Society has become increasingly powerful politically, their leader Gilthur Goblinbane is a powerful paladin and is advocating for dwarven purity and segregation. Humans will say the Rumnaheim Society is a dwarven self-help organization, that the dwarfs speak highly of Orin, but some will also be of the opinion that it is a fanatical organizations, based on hate towards humans, and they want to take over the mine. Orin will be difficult to break. Nobody has any dirt on him. The ones that know him well are hardcore Rumnaheim members. Issues at the mine: DC-12–the BMC has been expanding business, mining iron and copper ore. The BMC is mostly fair (for a large commercial concern), dwarfs are better paid than humans and, normally, dwarfs are in charge of planning etc. The dwarfs are upset that the BMC has taken much control over the mine engineering and planning in the last six months. A DC-19 check reveals there was a cave-in and a noxious gas was release a while ago. 26 people died (humans and dwarfs). The shaft was closed off for a while, then Godefrey sent in 6 dwarven engineers, some guards, human miners. Dwarfs never returned. That shaft is officially closed but heavily guarded and there is some activity. Only a few humans have access. Both are currently holed up at the Rumnaheim Society House with 8 dwarfs (use stats of a regular Guards MM) and 4 dwarven warriors (use stats of a Berserker MM). How to get access to the Rumnaheim Society? Below are some options, but let the players come up with a plan: Break-in/storm (leads to a stand-off with the dwarfs). Kilia’s parents can broker an introduction. They are allowed to enter but without weapons. Players have an advantage if a dwarf PC leads the interaction. Talking with Falin and Orin: If PCs start the conversation to inquire what the issues are–DC-14 for normal people, DC-10 for dwarfs: Pay for dwarfs hasn’t been increased, even though they have been working under increasingly higher quotas and more difficult conditions. BMC should pay for medical expenses–some miners have been getting sick. BMC is recruiting too many humans and especially unsavory ones. Have to do more to support the moral fibre of the community. Per original agreement, dwarfs are entitled to a 15% profit share. Want to increase this for future ore lines. Insight-DC12/16 check reveals that there is something else. Persuasion-DC10/14 to convince them to share. After the cave-in, the dwarfs were not allowed to recover the bodies of their dead. The team of engineers did not return. BMC said they got gas poisoning, dwarfs have no access to that shaft even though some mining is going on there. Dwarfs think the engineers are still alive. Godefrey seems to be hiding some mining and hiding profits–may have taken on a silent investor without informing the dwarfs, which would explain the rapid expansion over the last few months. Dwarfs will not call off the strike. They ask the players for help. They want them to break into the mines, explore the closed off shaft, and get the miners out. This will allow the dwarfs to confront Godefrey and change the management of the mine. They can offer a magical item as a reward. Note: if the PCs want to side with the BMC (who knows!), they’ll have to break the resolve of the dwarfs somehow. To get them back on the trail of Mencius, they might observe a meeting between Godefrey and Mencius, triggering a confrontation. 4.6 Going Deep If the PCs side with the dwarfs, they’ll need to find a way into the mines. Falin can help smuggle the players into the mining area. He sends one dwarf (Rufus) with them to guide them to the mine entrance. Players need to make some attempt at disguise/subterfuge. Smuggle in gear and themselves. Enter through the BMC gates, pass through the main square, enter the mining area and make their way to Mine Shaft South-4 (which has been sealed off and dwarfs are not allowed) Entrance is guarded by 2 guards (MM). There is also a magical barrier–30 HP, AC-15, resistance against piercing and slashing damage from nonmagical weapons. In the mine entrance area is an elevator platform. Three empty soles. 1st is 45m down, then 80m down, then 75m down, then another 80m down for the fourth level. See below the map for Level 4 of the mine. Figure 4.5: The Mine. Source: Homemade Level 4 of Mine Shaft South-4 is where the BMC is currently mining the poisonous but valuable ore telerium. This is also the reason why the river flowing into the Tallwood has been poisoned. The mining of the telerium in Mine Shaft South-4 is seeping into the river. Mencius was pushing for deeper exploration in this shaft, secretly hoping to a) find telerium and b) push through into the Underdark to make contact with the Duergar. The collapse was a cover story for breaking through to the Underdark. He facilitated a deal between the BMC and Duergar from the Underdark. Mencius knew the Duergar were in possession of one of the glass shards he was looking for and could provide him with living sample of the purple fungus needed to create dream dust (an ingredient for the more potent Andromalion’s Blessing). In order to get the BMC to make a deal with the Duerger, he proposed the secret but lucrative mining of telerium under the leadership of the Duergar. The poison gas accident was his way of covering up the murder of any witnesses to the original breakthrough to the Underdark and preparing the Level for Duergar access and closing it off from further scrutiny. The dwarfs of Bracken would have never allowed the mining of telerium due to the hazard it poses. The duergar down here are using the re-animated corpses of dead miners and dwarfs to mine the telerium. Encounters in the mine: M1: Elevator M2: Storage area. Here is were the telerium ore is being boxed for transport to the surface. 3 Duergar (MM) are on guard here. M3: A chain shirt is glinting in the corner. A Gelatinous Cube is hiding in a hole in the ceiling. The ooze will drop down to cut off the exit of any creature that tries to get the chain shirt. Passive Perception DC-15 to notice the ooze outright. M4: 1 Duergar Hammerer, 2 Duergar Soulblades patrol the area. M5: 10 Zombies are mining telerium. Not aggressive unless attacked. M6: Prison cells with rough iron bars worked into the stone. One surviving dwarf is held here. Guarded by 1 Earth Elemental (MM) and 1 Duergar (invisible). M7: Duergar HQ. Door is locked (DC-15) and trapped with a crossbow trap (pressure plate when walking through). Crossbow trap: 2x +8 attacks, 1d10 damage each, DC-15 to spot, DC-15 to disarm, less than 6 triggers the trap. 1 Duergar Mind Master, 2 Duergar Stone guards, 1 Duergar Hammerer. Loot: 2 common potions of healing Enlarge / Reduce Spell Scroll 8 +1 arrows / 4 walloping arrows 1 Onyx (50GP) Circlet of blasting Elemental gem–yellow diamond–Earth elemental Potion of growth Ring of resistance 4.7 Confronting the BMC Figure 4.6: The Mine. Source: Homemade Falin, upon receiving the news of the dead engineers and the Duergar mining operation, asks the players to storm the BCM main office to acquire documents of further proof. They’ll get to keep any valuables. Falin, Orin, and the dwarven warriors will come with them. While the PCs were exploring the mines, Mencius has decided to tie up loose ends. He has acquired the glass shard and a sample of living purple fungus. He has no more need for Godefrey and plans to replace him with a loyal member of the Church of Andromalion. When the attack by the dwarfs happens, he is in Godefrey’s office, having killed the head of the BMC. He uses his magic to temporarily assume Godefrey’s identity. Main goal: Confront Godefrey Find documents in main office. Encounters: Upon entry into the compound, the PCs and dwarfs will confront 25 guards (MM)–there does not have to be immediate violence. The guards will try to block access. At some point, Tolliver (stats of a Veteran) and 4 more guards join. Players can convince Tolliver and his men not to fight. If the PCs make it to Godefrey’s office, they’ll encounter Mencius, posing as Godefrey. For now, use the stats of an Illusionist (Volo’s p.214). 2 guards are present that are unaware that Mencius has killed the real Godefrey. Mencius will start with the Displacement special action. His mage armor is already active. He will use hypnotic pattern and magic missiles. Mencius will teleport away after some crowd control spells and summoning a Barlgura demon (the demon stays for 1d6 rounds after Mencius disappears). If the PCs manage to kill Mencius before he teleports, that’s ok. Let them have the victory. For one, the other Pillars can complete the plan. More importantly, Mencius has been growing a fungal clone of himself (via a casting of the Clone spell granted to him by Andromalion). In order not to cheapen the PCs victory in killing Mencius before the final chapter, the fungal version of Mencius is considerably weaker. 4.8 Conclusion PCs find Godefrey’s dead body Godefrey’s safe (DC-17): contains 400gp,his journal, and other documents. The jorunal details his excitement for the silent partnership with the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. He hopes the capital will allow him to push out the dwarfs. He meets Mencius as a representative of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank and his excitement increases further. Has misgivings that Mencius is pushing for exploration in the B shaft. Godefrey is enraged after the breakthrough to the Underdark. Thinks Mencius is crazy for thinking this a a good thing. Scared to meet with the Duergar, but Mencius’ promises of increased profits makes him reconsider. Plus the dwarfs are getting on his nerves and the Duergar’s help will be useful. Godefrey is excited about the prospect of telerium mining, starting to hire cheap labor in anticipation of the deaths that will eventually come with expanded telerium mining. Excited that the Duergar can raise the dead for mining. Mentions that Mencius is more focused on a side-deal with the Duergar. Lures a group of dwarf engineers into the shaft to allow the Duergar to learn more about the rest of the mine. On the suggestion of Mencius, he reaches out to the Blooded Hand to establish smuggling routes for the telerium. Notes that he observed a secret meeting between Mencius with the Duergar, where the Duergar gave Mencius a glass shard and some living fungi. Mencius kept the shard and had Tolliver organize a transport of the fungus to Flowerdale. Financial documents: Contract for a silent ownership share for the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. Letter that Mencius Moravian has been sent as Special Envoy of the Bank’s representative. Financial transactions for hiring extra security for a transport of fungi. Notes the location of Mencius’ office in Bracken. Mencius’ office: Large lockbox, locked, DC-14, inside: body of Lynn the Maid Locked desk with a trap (poison dart), Inside: 90 GP, Perception DC-18 a partially burned letter in the hearth: …Dear Brother, We are all waiting with elation to hear about your progress. I hope the letter I sent to establish you as an envoy of the Bank has been helpful. The others and I are praying for your safe return. The shard…. on paper with the seal of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. The letter also shows an odd, occult symbol. Figure 4.7: Occult Symbol. Additional rewards from the dwarfs: Absorb Elements Spell Scroll Elemental gem–red corundum–Fire elemental Potion of growth Dust of disappearance Hat of wizardy Overall XP Reward: enough to advance to Level 3. From here the PCs have two major leads, if they are inclined to investigate the mystery of Mencius and the shards: Investigate the connections between Mencius and the Helsundburg Merchant Bank in the city of Helsundburg (see Coin and Dagger. Pursue the fungal shipment to Flowerdale Flower Fields. If they are not yet hooked, not to worry. Mencius has taken an interest in the PCs and, arrrogant as he is, wants to use them for his own purposes. He will contact the PCs through an intermediary (see A Hired Hand). "],["hand.html", "Chapter 5 A Hired Hand 5.1 Overview 5.2 The Setup 5.3 The Heist 5.4 The Mansion 5.5 Back to Base 5.6 The Meet 5.7 The Reckoning 5.8 Next Steps", " Chapter 5 A Hired Hand 5.1 Overview Mencius has taken an interest in the PCS. In his arrogance, he wants to take revenge on them meddling in his affairs by duping htem into furthering his plans. He sends one of his agents, Akris, a Doppelganger, to hire the PCs to steal two shards from the Silversword family. The family’s ancestors were involved in confronting Andromalion during their last emergence. They helped save the city from destruction and captured the Sun-Harp. They broke it into five pieces. Three glass shards were hidden all over, two remained in the possession of the Silversword family. The current generation of Silverswords, mainly the elderly brother Gregor and Benjamin, have no real knowledge of their family’s involvement with the threat of Andromalion 227 years ago. Benjamin Silversword, who estranged from his brother Gregor Silversword, is in the possession of the two glass shards. He considers them interesting family heirlooms (among the few family items in his possession). he knows they have magical properties, but has never been able to fully determine their use. He currently lives in the Southern city Mersenne under the assumed name of Benoit La Tour d’Auvergné. He lived as an adventurer for many years, but settled in Mersenne twenty years ago for its warm climate, good wine, and more libertine culture compared to Helsundburg. He has become quite wealthy and is a respected member of the upper crust, having made a name for himself as a skilled Illusionist and organizer of lavish parties that are at the center of Mersenne’s social calendar. Akris’ mission is to acquire the glass shards from Benoit, using cutouts. He will assume the appearance and identity of Livius, a traveling bard, and member of the Lightbringers–a secret society rumored to work against the machinations of tyrants and evil wielders of magic. The Lightbringers are a secret organization, but residents of the Kingdom of Helsundburg will have heard of them. Akris will hire the PCs to steal the shards from Benoit, intimating that Benoit is planning the use the shards for an evil purpose or possibly being Mencius himself. The PCs are sent to Mersenne and make contact with Tiv Telemer, a local crime syndicate head, to help them organize the heist. The PCs will implement their heist plans and then meet with Tiv, whos has been ordered to kill the PCs and take the shards. Surviving the ambush, the PCs can extract information from Tiv to confront his employer at an abandonded farm house. There, the PCs will uncover Akris’ duplicity and learn more about the Church of Andromalion. After the confrontation with Akris, Benoit tracks down the PCs and may offer an alliance. 5.2 The Setup 5.2.1 Relevant NPCs Akris– A Doppelganger (MM) and trusted agent of Mencius’. Currently travels under the assumed identity of Livius, a bard and member of the Lightbringers. Benoit La Tour d’Auvergné a.k.a. Benjamin Silversword. In his late 50s. Master Illusionist, lives in Mersenne. Makes his living as an illusionist for the upper crust of Mersenne. Socialite and collector. Currently in a relationship with Raphael Ortalam, a former dancer. Use stats of an Illusionist. Tiv Telemer. Human in his 40s. Head of local crime syndicate, runs a transportation business as a front. Use statistics of a Scoundrel. He employs a pair of bodyguards. Yellow is a Half-Orc Enforcer. Purple is a gnome assassin. 5.2.2 The Offer The PCs receive a message from a courier: Dear esteemed heroes of Bracken, the story of your deeds has traveled far and reached our ears. It seems that, by lucky coincidence, your past troubles intersect with our own concerns. The mysterious glass shards you have encountered are part of a dark plot we must foil by all means. We hope to convince you of the sincerity of our intentions and purity of our cause in person. Please accept our invitation and meet us in Ridwall on the 1st of September at the Northwall House. Ask for my name. Signed, Livius, Symbol: The Flame of the Lightbringers. The PC should organize travel to Ridwall. On the way to Ridwall, 2 days of travel from the Wayward Inn, the PCs find the scene of a battle. Three wagons, partially burned and destroyed, the corpses of 12 guards, 8 merchants. Nature DC-13 reveals: goblin arrows, bugbear footprints. Nature DC-15 or History DC-14 reveals how organized and disciplined the attack was, two teams of archers and a bugbear strike team. Highly unusual. PCs may also meet a group of 35 Dragonborn mercenaries on their way to Rumnahold (for a possible social encounter). They were contracted to provide security for a merchant concern due to increased goblin attacks. When the PCs arrive at the Northwall House and ask for Livius, they are pointed towards the Burnt Rose Tavern. He is entertaining the guests there. Dingy tavern, but in the corner, a handsome bard is playing some songs. The PCs will have to wait a bit and let him finish his set. If they introduce themselves, he asks them to go for a walk outside, away from prying eyes and eavesdroppers. He thanks them for saving the poor people of the Wayward Inn and helping the Bracken community. He surmises they found evidence of a secret agent operating in Bracken that was scheming to acquire the shards. He asks what evidence they found. He is willing to reveal that the Lightbringers have been tracking a secret cult that has shown interest in such glass shards. They have heard more whispers than concrete evidence. This is all a conconcted story to convince the PCs of Akris’ intentions. We don’t know how many there are and what exact purpose they have, only that some powerful dark magic is involved. This cult has been unscrupulous it seems. We think we have identified one of its leaders. He already has two shards in his possession. In public, he poses as a Master Illusionist in Mersenne. His name is Benoit La Tour d’Auvergne. He lives in a fancy mansion in the city. We want you to break in and steal the two shards, without causing too much of a stir. We can offer 1,000 GP as a reward and an expense budget of 150 GP plus any information we can acquire in the meantime on the shards and the cult. We have arranged for a local contact that can assist you (within reason). His name is Tiv Telemer, a local fixer with connections to the criminal world. You can meet him at his place of business: Telemer Carriage Company. He can supply you with some basic information, contacts, and a base of operations. If you accept this task, we will be in touch with you through Tiv. 5.3 The Heist 5.3.1 Mersenne A trade hub on the Southern coast. More than 8,000 inhabitants. Ruled by a governing council of nobles and merchants. Powerful factions: guilds, nobles, merchants, adventurers. 5.3.2 Arrival of the PCs Play up the bustling urban atmosphere after the rural beginnings of the adventure. Make sure to describe the variety of smells, ranging from refuse to exotic spices and perfumes. Possible encounters (taken from Waterdeep City Encounters): Angry Mob: 3 Thugs lead a mob of 11 commoners from the Guild of Butchers, dragging a halfling piemaker through the streets. He sold unlicensed scotch eggs, they have dipped him in butter and rolled him in mince and bread crumbs. The Halflings name is Theodore Tillweasel. Chamber Pot: A homeowner empties a chamber pot of night soil from a second story window. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or be spattered by the sloppy contents. Who emptied the pot? A maid in the service of a wealthy lawyer. Her master is abusive, and bombing pedestrians is one of her few little pleasures. A tinkling bell announces a man pushing a cart of grilled fish kebabs which he claims were caught this morning. Gerdon, the vendor, hears and sees a lot as he wanders the streets and can share a wealth of stories so long as the characters purchase a kebab from him for 2 cp. If you have a specific rumor to plant, Gerdon is a perfect source. Challenge to a game of Dragonchess, contest of INT checks. The PCs observe a Drow trade delegation from an Underdark city. Two competing companies of kobolds and goblins fight over trash and refuse collection. At night, PCs encounter 2 cornered goblins and 10 kobolds that are about to kill them. 5.3.3 Meeting Tiv The Telemer Carriage Company is located at the Southeastern edge of the Dock Ward, close to the water. The PCs arrive at the busy compound of the Telemer Carriage Company. Bustling carriages are going in and out. They can ask a guard for Tiv. He points them to the office building. Tiv is sitting at his desk, working on paper, shouting at staff. He is a human male in his 40s. He is wearing high-quality but functional leather clothing, a rapier dangles at his side. Sly smile. Welcomes the players. Takes them to a side room, offers a drink. He shares that he sometimes does favors for the Lightbringers, Livius has been his contact. Help he can offer: Safehouse in the Dock district. Fake papers for a cover story: they have been hired by an out-of-town merchant to find his runaway son. His bodyguards, Yellow and Purple, can assist them with acquiring more specific information or get access to certain goods and services. They will be the go-between and will check in on the party. Both enter and introduce themselves. Tiv knows that Benoit has left for a summer festival in the countryside surrounding the city. He will be gone for approximately one month. This may be a good opportunity. He instructs them to to bring the shards immediately to Tiv, who will handle the hand-off to the Lightbringers. 5.3.4 Preparing for the Heist The PCs may want to investigate Benoit further. See below clues that can be gathered: PCs can start asking questions in fancy bars, likely to be frequented by Benoit. Persuasion skill check: 13–15: He is a bonvivant, likes expensive things (drinks, food, art, artifacts). Has a good reputation among the upper crust. 16–17: He is a constant guest and the major Mersenne events and private parties. Has become very wealthy. Has allowed him to purchase a city mansion in the Sea Ward. He lives there with his partner Raphael and a small staff. 18+: With some digging, there are some darker rumors about him, how he acquired his initial wealth and then became so quickly a successful Master Illusionist (e.g., he made a pact with a devil, he is the agent of a notorious wizard cabal, he betrayed his former adventuring group). Also some dark rumors about select private parties he participates in–the kind of events for the most wealthy, were all kinds of things happen and are hushed up. Important: nobody really knows where he is from (Sidenote: some of these rumors have been created by Mencius). In truth, Benoit is a kind individual with a good heart. He cares for his friends and staff. He does like to party but has settled a bit since he has been dating Raphael. Someone mentions an old acquaintance of Benoit–Gustav Mirebrook. With some effort, they hear about a former adventurer that knows Benoit well: Gustav Mirebrook. A human fighter of some renown, now drinks too much. Hangs out at the Red Gauntlet Tavern in the South Ward. Dislikes Benoit for having abandoned him. Can be convinced to tell the PCs about his past. He asks them to do a fetch quest for him. He was hired to retrieve a divine relic of the Goddess of Trade, a silver plate. He found it after some digging but was waylaid by a band of Orcs. He barely got away. Since then, he has been drinking and hoaring away the big advance in Mersenne. He can give them the location of the Orc hide-out. The location is in Hex 1310 to the West (travel by boat to Hex 1212 dramatically reduced travel time). Orc Hide-out: Survival DC-14 \\(+\\) check to find the right spot in Hex 1310. Travel and searching in the mountains may trigger random wilderness encounters. At the bottom of the path, 3 Orcs (MM) stand watch. In the compound: 6 Orcs (MM) + Orog (MM), 1 Ogre Chain Brute (MM) chained up and held as a slave. In the cave: 1 Orc Eye of Gruumsh, 4 Orcs, 1 Direwolf (loyal pet of the leader). Loot: the relic, 96 GP. Figure 5.1: Orc Hide-out. Source: Homemade On their return, Gustav can tell them: Benoit has been living in Waterdeep for over twenty years. He is originally from Helsundburg, comes from some important family, but apparently had a falling out. His real name is Benjamin Benny Silversword. Can you believe it?! He lived as an adventurer after leaving Helsundburg, acquired some riches, worked with Gustav for quite a while, settled in Mersenne and became a very successful Master Illusionist. Now, he is a fancy twat and doesn’t remember his friends anymore!! Don’t know anything about dark magic. He was a skilled wizard as an adventurer. Pretty good summoner as well Information that can be gathered about Benoit’s mansion: Blue prints: Tiv can put the PCs in touch with a local contact that might be able to access blueprints. Female Gnome bookseller (Nyxadora Fapplestamp) and seven Kenku assistants are the contact to acquire illegal copies of documents. When the PCs arrive, the Kenku are currently making copies of novel 7 is the Dusklight saga, a series of romance novels that includes vampires, weretigers, etc. Mini-quest: collect payment of 200 GP from a former customer in exchange for the blueprints. Former customer is a dwarven butcher, Ogman Ogmandur. He needed some forged documents to retain assets in an acrimonious divorce. PCs can confront him in his butcher shop. He is a tough guy (Berserker) and has 4 apprentices/thugs with him. Alternatively, PCs can rat him out to his ex-wife, Helja Fireforge (Barbarian), who will go ape-shit on his ass. Afterwards, Nyxadora tells them that the blueprints have been destroyed, which is very unusual. He suggest they find someone that has been to one of the parties—there is bard (Florio Featherquill) that is part of that scene they can find. Florio Featherquill (Halfling violinist) is a teacher at the Mersenne College of Bards. Can tell them Some rough description of the inside Some description of the staff Several cats roam the mansion Has heard some rumors about magical traps and that some of the statues in the mansion can move. Library at the third floor, not sure how to get to the fourth. Raphael mentioned some kind of secret passage. The PCs may also want to inquire about the staff of the mansion: Dietrich, the dwarven butler, has worked for Benoit for 20 years. Lives in the mansion. Takes one 1-hour walk around town, eating nuts he buys from a street vendor, admiring the architecture. Once a week he goes to the market, buys a bottle of wine and grapes, a poetry book. Goes to a local park and waits on a bench. Meets a female dwarf, Ulga Underway, house manager of another wealthy household. He reads poetry to her. He has master keys to the house. Oglenna Whim, head chef and housekeeper. Works with a staff of 2 (her daughter and another young woman) to cook and clean. They arrive early in the morning at 5am and leave at 4 pm. She has a key to lower level of the house. Morfin Rotulund, Halfling gardener, comes once a week. Has a key to the garden gate. Daily deliveries from the market via a service. Drops off deliveries at 6am. 5.4 The Mansion Figure 5.2: Mansion Level 1. Source: Homemade Figure 5.3: Mansion Level 2. Source: Homemade Figure 5.4: Mansion Level 3. Source: Homemade Figure 5.5: Mansion Level 4. Source: Homemade There are cats all over the mansion. They have the uncanny ability to see invisible creatures. The mansion is secured by a mix of spells and magical traps. Spells can be detected with Detect Magic and dispelled with Dispel Magic. Magical Traps can be disarmed with an Arcana Check. Garden: Glyph of Warding (Stinking Cloud) on the stones and 1 Animated Armor that activates when plates are stepped on. Trap can be disabled with an Arcana DC-16 check. Ground floor: The foyer, kitchen, staff quarters, and a dining room. The doors have normal locks (DC-16), 4 Animated Armors, 2 Flying Swords that activate when a pressure plate in the diing room is stepped on. The trap can be disabled with an Arcana DC-16 check. Second floor: Benoit’s master bedroom and guest rooms. The doors on this floor are trapped with a magical trap that triggers the Sleep spell (Level 3, 9d8 HP) and releases 1 Air Elemental. A disarmament check below DC-22 avoids sleep but triggers the Air elemental. Third floor: Benoit’s library. A Glyph of Warding (Crown of Madness) is triggered if anything on the main writing desk is touched. The stairs to the fourth floor have been hidden via permanent a Major Image and an altered aura. To reveral the secret passage, the PCs need to solve a puzzle. If PCs are searching the area, reveal the following: Four statues: one with a sword, one with a shield, one with a helmet, one with a breastplate. Four marble floor plates that are of a different color. On the North wall hangs a big painting, titled The Colors of Magic. It depicts a man on on a white horse, casting a spell with his wand, through a prism, causing swirling colors. Under it is a small empty bookshelf. Arcana DC-19: The wizard is the famousillusionist Yondril Filvianus. Yondril wrote the famous series of books, the Colors of Magic, an Illusionists Guide. Six books total. Known as the Yellow Book, The Violet Book, The Red Book, The Green Book, the Blue Book, the Orange Book. Books have to be arranged in ROYGBV order on the bookshelf. Fourth floor: All valuable items are warded by Symbol (Discord/Sleep/Insanity) and 1 Stone Golem. The golem stands in the center of the magic circle and is activated if any of the wards a triggered. Magic traps can be identified with Perception DC-15 and disabled with Arcana DC-15. Valuable items: Rare painting (2000 GP) (warded with Insanity) 100 GP and Gems worth 500 GP in a small display (warded with Discord) Prominently displayed items in a large display case (warded with Fear): Boots of False Tracks, Cloak of Billowing, Cloak of Many Fashions, Hat of Wizardry, Instrument of Illusions, Perfume of Bewitching, Staff of Flowers, Wand of Pyrotechnics Unwarded, old adventuring items: 2 Spell scrolls 2nd level, 1 potion of frost giant strength, Heward’s Handy Haversack The two glass shards are in an unassuming bookshelf, unwarded. 5.5 Back to Base If the PCs retrieve the shards and return, as instructed to Tiv’s compound, an ambush is waiting for them. Yellow (Veteran), Purple (Spy, with a light crossbow 1d8+3, hidden and assassinate/sneak attack), 5 Bandits, and 4 Thugs are positioned in the compund. At least for the the Bandits have taken position in rooftops with light crossbows. The others are hiding inside the buildings. Tiv (Bard) is hiding in his office. If captured, Tiv can tell the PCs that he was hired to kill them, send a message, and bring the shards to an abandoned farm house day later at midnight. The same information can be found in Tiv’s safe (he wears the key around is neck), which also contains 230 gp. Figure 5.6: Tiv’s Compound. Source: Homemade 5.6 The Meet Tiv was meant to meet Livius outside of Mersenne at an abandoned farm house. The PCs can set up their own ambush. Note that Akris has already positioned 1 Gibbering Mouther in the pond close to the farm house before the PCs arrival. Main group of antagonists: Akris (Doppelganger), 1 Cult Fanatic, 2 Cultists. Additional backup (approaches from the forest to the North): 1 Cult Fanatic and 3 Cultists. When fighting breaks out, the Gibbering Mouther crawls out of the pond and attacks the PCs. The cultists are weirdly malformed with fungal growths and some have special powers: Spore Kissed (poison damage in 10ft radius upon death equal to its hit dice, 2d8, immune to frightened and charmed), some can cast Ray of Sickness and Plant growth. Cultists can also re-enter battle as animated fungal Zombies, if need be. Figure 5.7: The Abandoned Farmhouse. Source: Homemade 5.7 The Reckoning The PCs may return the shards to Benoit directly. If they hold on to the shards, Benoit will catch up with them (accompanied by a large group of bodyguards) to confront them about the shards. If the PCs explain their situation, Benoit forgives the players, wants them to help him figure out what is going on. The shards are related to his family and he will consult some of his family’s old documents. They can keep some magic items from his vault (time to offer some useful magic items that fit the group) Benoit finds some old journal notes, from 230 years ago. His family was involved in some kind of plot to protect the city. The family’s journal reveals that one ancestor came into possession of five glass shards and hid three of them outside of Helsundburg. One was left with a trusted dwarf–Torrga Wyrmstalker–in Rumnahold. The location of the other two is unclear. The family kept the two remaining shards in the family vault for safe keeping. 5.8 Next Steps From here, the PCs have several choices: Investigate the Helsundburg Merchant Bank in the city of Helsundburg (see Coin and Dagger. Pursue the fungal shipment to Flowerdale Flower Fields. Investigate a possible shard in Rumnahold Mountains of Madness. Mencius will start harassing the PCs on their journey. If the go on a river journey to safe time, use the suggested encounter below for an assassination attempt. You can easily adapt this to overland travel. If they go on a river journey, PCs can hire Murin Myrtlebeard and his riverboat. At some point, the boat will dock at a small river village called Eren Hill that is celebrating a town festival that day. The riverboat docks here, PCs are spending the night and can engage in some activities. Shopping Skill challenges: Shooting a bow. Dex/Acrobatics challenge. Running or jumping against locals. Beggar on the street that acosts a PC, suddenly shows the face of Mencius: Do you have some coin—give me the shard—I SAID GIVE ME THE SHARD, EVERYONE YOU LOVE WILL DIEEEE. PCs start seeing Mencius everywhere, all commoners stop and look at them with Mencius face, which twists into a manic grin. Mencius will appear in their dreams that night. Don’t you want to be happy? Take the shards from Benoit…all your worries will go away Mencius will Geas the riverboat captain’s cook (Murin Myrtlebeard’s wife Martha) to poison the players while she is shopping in town. 2 days later, Murin will host a great dinner for the PCs. Food and drink are poisoned (as was the breakfast and food for the last 2 days). The attack happens at night. PCs hear the alarm bells of the ship. Run out to see several fires. Mercenary Hobgoblin attack: 10 Hobgoblins, 1 Hobgoblin Captain, 1 Hobgoblin Devastator. Poison effects: DC-16 CON saving throw, on failure Poisoned condition, 1d6 poison damage every turn for 4 turns and every 8 hours a level of exhaustion. On success: 1d6 poison damage. The Hobgoblins arrive via smaller boats and set the riverboat on fire. Make sure to use the fire on the boat as a spatial obstacle and timer for the combat. Figure 5.8: Eren Hill.

If they are already allies with Benoit, they can make contact with his brother Gregor and get involved with investigating a string of grisly murders. Who at the Helsundburg Merchant Bank could have directed Mencius? Benoit knows that a Special Envoy could have only been sent by a Director. There are five directors, one of which is the Director-General. The current Director-General has passed away (in truth, poisoned by Mencius). The nine members of the Board of Governors are about to select a new Director-General among the four remaining directors. The Church of Andromalion is attempting to control the votes via blackmail and murder. The blackmail is organized via the House of the Red Door. PCs can investigate all four remaining directors. A series of murders seems to be tied to some of the directors.PCs can/have to investigate. The presumed murderer has been sent to a prison island to await his execution. PCs need to break into the prison and question the murderer to learn the identity of the mysterious figure behind the murders. During the PC’s visit to the prison island, the Klausman Torfburg is elected as Director-General of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. PCs confront Klausman in his private sanctum in the House of the Red Door. 6.2 General Investigation of the Glass Shards, the Occult Symbol, and the Church The PCs may want to engage in some archival research about the glass shards or the mysterious occult symbol from the burned letter. The best location for this kind of work is the Grand Archive in Helsundburg. 3 PCs get to use their skills for the research activity. First, PCs have to make a persuasion skill check to get access resources from the local library: $&lt;$10: 1 day, 10-15:5 days, 15-20: 10 days, 20-25: 15 days. After that, PCs can pay a bribe of 50 GP per 5 days Five areas: Nature, History, Arcana, Performance, and Religion. PCs decide what to research and how many days to invest. For each 2 days they get a +1 on their skill check. No help action, no guidance. Results in each category: Performance/Musical instrument: 15–18: A somewhat obscure bard, Wendell Ulthador, left that symbol on some of his compositions (for the harp). 18–20: 20 years later, there was a suicide at the College of Music in Helsundburg. A young, talented bardic student had chosen Wendell’s music as their object of study. $&gt;$20: That student was a member of a small religious sect, and you locate their Book of Hymns—an old text, written in a Common dialect, details ten hymns of the Church of Andromalion. Hymn texts are all about joy, happiness, and change towards beauty. The hymns suggest Andromalion is an angel or deity of sorts. Some of the sheet music is odd, not all written in standard notation, mostly for harps, some passages seem quite melodic and beautiful, some passages shouldn’t be playable and have weird dissonant notes. History: 15–18: Find a diary from 250 years ago of a young religious merchant son that joined the Church of Andromalion on his travels. He describes his initial elation, but his family seems reserved about his convictions. The diary describes his slow withdrawal from his family. He seems to become obsessed with his cleft palate and changing it. Notes that singing hymns in Church makes him happy. Eventually declines into madness. 18–20: Records reveal all seven members of the merchant family died at the same time. The grave can be found in the Helsundburg Graveyard. $&gt;$20: Find notes of the Watchmaster: The young man murdered his family and then danced naked on the streets until his death from exhaustion. Autopsy notes make no mention of the cleft palate. Nature: 15–18: Find the reports of a group of rangers that were commissioned by the Sword of Justice of Helsundburg to investigate some disappearances in a town nearby about 230 years ago. On arrival, the find that the mayor is missing as well. Report mentions the symbol being etched into the missing mayor’s desk. 18–20: Second report describes how they find a hideous aberration in the nearby forest and kill hit. Turns out the aberration was the mayor, just terribly transformed. $&gt;$20: A third report details how they find a lair with three Doppelgangers, more of the symbol etched into the walls, Doppelgangers were growing some kind of fungus. Religion: 15–18: Andromalion is not a known greater or lesser deity–but could be a different avatar of an established deity. 18–20: From the few records you find, he seems to be associated with ecstatic happiness, music, and change towards beauty. $&gt;$20: You find scattered records of the Church of Andromalion. Worship seems to pop up infrequently throughout time. Always geographically concentrated. Very small religious group, but always attached to important local families. Arcana: 15–18: Find no association to the symbol or the name Andromalion. Sometimes other beings, like devils, demons, or entities from the far realm pose as angels or deities to prey on mortals. $&gt;$18: Based on the spells he used and likely abilities, Mencius seems to be a wizard or warlock. Once they learn about the Church of Andromalion, they can specifically research it. Benoit’s family records reveal that the CoA was active in Helsundburg about 230 years ago. They had an important relic: the Ilioprisma or Sunharp–a sun catcher wind chime made from glass shards that can create music and swirling lights. It was central to the Church, used during their religious service. When the stars are aligned, the high priest can supposedly use them to play the Song of Bliss and help mortals achieve union with Andromalion, promising a path to beauty and eternal happiness. Whatever the true purpose of the Sunharp, Mencius clearly is working hard to collect all five shards. More in-depth research can reveal the The Legend of the Lost City of Tzz’a: The City of Tzz’a was an ancient city state in the desert of the Southern Reach, populated by serpentfolk. The city was embroiled in some religious schism between the main cult of Sseth and some new sect, which your research indicates to be an earlier incarnation of the Church of Andromalion (the use of music and art, the theme of change and beauty). Historical sources suggest that the First Sorcerer-Priest of Tzz’a had developed a plan of destroying Andromalion with the help of a devil: Paimoraxxas. Paimoraxxas may know more. Maybe there is a way of contacting him with a summoning ritual. The PCs can proceed to Into the Desert with this information. They city was destroyed by some unknown disease and lost to history–nobody knows its actual location anymore (somewhere in the Souther Reach desert). Treasure hunters have been after it, but nobody has found it. 6.3 Investigating the Helsundburg Merchant Bank The PCs will want to take a closer look at the Helsundburg Merchant Bank, specifically who there is an ally of Mencius. The Helsundburg Merchant Bank is an old money-lending operation with deep roots in the city. Founded over 300 years ago by wealthy merchant families, it currenlty is the premier financial institution of the Kingdum of Helsund. Its shareholders are wealthy merchants as well as several nobel families. From the letter fragment they recovered in Bracken, they can determine that Mencius had the title of Special Envoy for the Bank–which can only be conferred at the direction of one of the five Directors of the Bank. The PCs can quickly find some preliminary information on the directors: Alois Waldhof, human, aged 73 (recently deceased), Director-General of the Bank. Hails from the founding family of the Bank and was its accomplished leaders for the last thirty years. Klausman Torfburg, halfling, auburn hair, 53 years old, started as a mail clerk in the Bank, has worked his way up. Portfolio: trade financing, human resources. Secretly a Pillar of the Church of Andromalion and Mencius’ contact in the bank. Outwardly friendly, curious, and exacting. Valeria Alvandorian, female, white-haired Elf, 300 years old, has worked for the Bank a long time, over 65 years, also a wizard. Portfolio: internal accounting, royal accounts. Kimora Iomander, dark-skinned human female, 61 years old, switched from a different bank, raised in a wealth merchant family. Portfolio: wealth management in Helsundburg, diplomatic relations. Marcus Lord Strongsilver, white human male, 41 years old, member of a noble family, part of the Bank for 5 years. Portfolio: Security. Anything beyond simple inquiries will quickly draw the attention of the Bnak and Gregor Silversword, First Sword of Justice of Helsundburg. As the primary law enforcement officer, he is keeping tabs on any outsiders trying to unsettle the balance of power in the city. He has no particular loyalty to the Bank, even disdaisn them for there mundane exploits, but will try to minimize any potential scandals. He will act as gatekeeper to any serious investigation of powerful individuals in Helsundburg, i.e. the directors, unless the PCs gain his trust. A superficial investigation of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank reveals two odd things: the current Director-General recently passed away and the remaining four Directors are now jockeying for the top job. Also, a well-known minority shareholder as recently murdered (see A Bloddy Trail]) and a mysterious symbol was carved on the body–the symbol was printed on a news leaflet and looks like the Occult symbol from the letter found in Mencius’ Bracken office. The PCs might be suspicious whatever is going on with the Director-General election and the murders is tied to Mencius. If the PCs are already allied with Benoit, he will send a letter of introduction with the PCs to give them access to Gregor. If the PCs have not yet met Benoit they can try to win Gregor’s trust by helping with the murder investigation. Alternatively, the PCs can try to remain unnoticed and investigate the Bank and the murders on their own. 6.4 Meeting Gregor Silversword Gregor Silversword is the leader of the House Silversword, an influential family in Helsundburg. He is also the First Sword of Justice (chief of police) in Helsundburg–a responsibility he takes very seriously. Benoit can give the PCs a letter of introduction to gain access to Gregor. Although Benoit and Gregor have not spoken with each other in years, Gregor is open to the idea of Benoit returning into the family fold. With Benoit’s introduction, the PCs can get an audience with Gregor in the Silversword’s beautiful mansion. Gregor is older than Benoit, gruff, formal, and strict. He has not forgiven his brother for running away but still loves him. He is not very interested in the PC’s messing with the Helsundburg Merchant Bank, because he does not fully trust them. He offers a deal: help him investigate a string of grisly murders and he will make some discreet inquiries about the Directors of the Bank. If the PCs have not yet met Benoit or are not allied with him, there are still ways of getting involved in the murder investigation: Gregor, nominally responsible for the murder investigation, has put pressure on Captain Hemlock to solve this problem. Hemlock is far out of his depth and can be easily convinced/conned to have the PCs take on the role of investigators. One of the victims (Rufus Tarrenhouse) was an active member of a regular church congregation and the local head priest is looking for adventurers to apprehend the murdered. The priest is critical of the city watch and does not trust them. He can put pressure on Captain Hemlock to give the PCs access to the investigation. 6.5 A Bloody Trail PCs can meet with Captain Hemlock, nominally in charge of the murder investigation. Hemlock, a 50 year-old human paladin, is comfortable with war and fighting ruffians, but does not seem up to dealing with murders like these. He says as much. He is open to the help of the PCs but also a bit suspicious. Overview: The murders are all tied to the Director-General Election and the House of the Red Door. The Murders are performed by the Klausman’s henchman Balthazar. He has the help of the Canal Rats, a local crime gang that controls the canalization. They control the underground tunnels via a series of locked gates. It is not easy to pass without their help. While Balthazar acts under the direction of Klausman, he adds his own flourishes. Being a devoted follower of Andromalion, he sees the murders as a form of worship and a way of transforming himself. Major clues about the killer: Skilled with a blade, medical skills. Left-handed, tall and strong. Uses dream dust. Has help from the Canal Rats. Victims were tied to the House of the Red Door. After the murders are complete, Klausman gets a patsy to confess to the murders and gives the patsy some real knowledge only the murderer would have to make their statement more credible. He gets sent to Skral prison island. The PCs know/suspect he is not the real murderer and that the Canal Rats have helped. The leader of the Canal Rats resided on Skral island as well. PCs have to infiltrate prison island, win an audience with the Rat King, and win a fighting tournament for him to get information form him and talk to the patsy. 6.5.1 Murder Victim 1 Killed 7 days ago. A wealthy merchant woman, Valeria Tallwater, 61 years old. Widow, 2 adult children. Daughter (Mary) married off to another wealth family, son (Connal) works in the family business. Family Business: Clove trade. She is also a minority shareholder in the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. She has a seat on the Board of Governors and was set to vote on the new Director-General. Crime scene: Business cantor of the family trading business. The room has been left as it was. Large desk, full of papers, half eaten biscuits, a cup of cold tea. Quite a lot of blood spread around. Give the following information without any need for a skill check: She was killed on the desk itself, single murderer (footprints in the blood), not many signs of a struggle, some fine powder residue around her chair. Additional information: DC-12 Investigation check check reveals she was sprayed with some powder. Nature DC-12: looks like dream dust. Survival DC-17: bloody footprints lead out of the room, into the hallway, but then vanish (stepped on a thick carpet). Witness 1: Carlos, clerk, 56 years old, has worked all his life for the family. He saw her last. Brought her a stack of documents, some tea and biscuits around 9 pm, then went home. She was working late, as she often does. Persuasion DC-18: the lady had an argument recently with her son about the future of the business. She is a woman of her own mind, everyone in the city knows that. General rumor check in the merchant community: Persuasion DC-15 reveals that she was rumored to have had different opinions on the upcoming Director-General election compared to her son. Rumor check on Connal: partyboy but also a shrewd businessman, his mother and him disagreed a lot but both had good ideas. He is known to let loose in town, in all kinds of high-end establishments reserved for the upper crust (House of the Red Door). If, for whatever reason, they confront Connal, he possesses a red card and used to gain entrance to the House. Investigating the body: players can visit the local morgue, clerics of Kelemvor have preserved the body with spells. DC-12 Investigation check: plump, old woman, sharp features, several deep stab wounds, symbol of Andromalion carved into her chest, her eyes look truly terrified. ** DC-14 Medicine check**: she may have been paralyzed, no defense wounds, death by blood loss, her liver was cut out, cuts were precise, workmanlike (not a surgeon), left-handed. True reason for the murder: she was about to vote on a different Director, instead her son will take that position and vote for Klausman. He is in the thrall of the Church of Andromalion due to his time in the House of the Red Door. 6.5.2 Murder Victim 2 Killed 3 days ago. Rufus Tarrenhouse, advocatus. 46 years old, human, unmarried. Had a thriving law practice. Small office in the merchant quarter, 2 clerks worked for him. No children. Crime scene: Murdered in his apartment, not too far from the office. Found by the housekeeper. His cats were already feasting on him. Murdered in his bed. Obvious clues: blood all over the bed, ropes on the bedframe, dream dust residue. Building has a very secure front door and a doorman. Apartment is on the 4th floor. If the players visit the office: they can talk with the clerks and take a look at the office. Learn about the important case he was arguing in front of the royal court. It was about a dispute over a land inheritance. He was representing a distant relation of a deceased lord, fighting one of the richest land-owning families in Helsund, House Corwin. Persuasion/Intimidation DC-20: clerk reveals that he was worried. Rufus may have found evidence that one of the judges was favoring the Corwin’s. The country is run by a small group of noble families and wealthy merchants. It’s on old buys club, they grow up together, go to school together, are part of the same hunting clubs, secret societies, they frequent the same gentlemen’s establishments–they all stick together and protect each other, very corrupt! When pushed: the clerk can share a rumor about the House of the Red Door—anything goes there, a Djinn or devil runs it, fulfills any wish, the clerk says Rufus thought members of House Corwin have been seen there. Witness: the housekeeper. Found him in the morning, windows were closed and locked. Had seen him the morning before, he had been stressed recently due to an important case. The body: DC-12 Medicine check: body has been preserved by clerics, symbol etched into the body, heart removed, chest opened, more stab and slashing wounds, this time more haphazard, victim was alive during the stabbing. Real reason for the murder: Rufus was preparing an argument at the Royal Court of Justice against the claim on a land and title for a board member (House Corwin). Klausman offered to make the suit go away in exchange for a supportive vote. 6.5.3 Murder Victim 3 Happens on day 2 of the PC’s investigation. Guard walks them over to the place the body was found. If allied with Gregor, he will join them in the walk to the murder scene. He is very unhappy, because this makes him look bad. They run into a detachment of knights of the Order of the Crimson Heart and their Local Commander, Vraxa Redstar (a secret Pillar of the Church of Andromalion). She wants to use this as a opportunity to look good—Gregor points out that she is very ambitious. A body spilled out of a canalization tunnel in the poorer part of town. The body got caught in an iron grid of one of the adjacent open canals. Guard fished the body out. Currently she is lying on a nearby embankment. Obvious clues: It is the bodt of a very beautiful, blonde young woman. A lot of stab and slash wounds, extra mutilation, bite marks (kind of human looking), victim was alive during the stabbing (probably paralyzed again), eyes cut out, symbol etched into the body. She has a distinctive tattoo on her left leg (roses with thorns). Determining the identity of the victim: Can start asking around the neighborhood. Ask the PCs where they want to ask (pubs, markets, temples, house-to-house, stores, rich/poor, etc.). This should take 1-4 days. If they ask around in poor pubs, temples in poor areas and pass a Persuasion DC-15 check, they hear the name Rose McMurry. Equipped with that name and a successful Persuasion DC-17 check, they can learn that she was a young woman from a poor neighborhood, maybe 20 years old, has a slightly older brother, Eamon. She worked as a barmaid, temple assistant of Ilmater, but not for a while. Her brother is very protective of her, is affiliated with the Golden Triangle. He is a captain of the gang and well-connected. Golden Triangle: a local criminal gang, most important next to the Canal Rats. They are into gambling, protection, sex trafficking, smuggling. Canal Rats do similar things but also more into thieving, murder for hire, smuggling. One of their known hang-outs is the Drowning Flagon–a tavern close to the harbor. Drowning Flagon: PCs can visit. This is a gang affiliated hang-out. Patrons are gang members, wannabes, friends etc. Tavern has three levels. Present: several commoners, 5 bandits, 1 bandit captain, 3 berserkers, 4 thugs, 2 veterans. They are hostile to the PCs. Easy to start a fight–not to death per se but could escalate. If the PCs start asking questions about Rose or Eamon, they will get in their face. Will challenge one of the PCs to a drunk fist fight with a berserker in a part of the tavern with a painted rectangle (passive perception DC-16 reveals the trapdoor). PC has to chug a big glass of liquor (Constitution Saving Throw DC-14 or be poisoned). Then unarmed fighting. If the fight goes badly for the berserker, he steps aside and the trap door is triggered. Under the trapdoor is a drop of 5 ft, down into a pool of water. Water also contains 4 crocodiles. Thugs give allies the option of throwing the PC an axe, longsword, dagger, a spear. If the PC kills 2+ crocodiles, the gang is sufficiently impressed. Alternatively, a huge brawl breaks out and the players need to put down a number of the gang to make them stand down. They are ready to talk afterwards. Figure 6.1: Drowning Flagon. Source: Homemade Eamon will return in 2 days from a mission, they can meet him at the docks, his ship is the Bearclaw. PCs will have to succeed on some Persuasion DC-16 rolls to make Eamon believe their sincerity, he wants to see his sisters body. He is clearly distraught. He reveals that Rose has always received a lot of attention from men, she had been working as a companion for wealthy individuals off an on–he never liked it an they often fought about it. More recently, through a friend, she got the opportunity to work at a special establishment: The House of the Red Door. He doesn’t really know much about it, only that this kind of place has existed in Helsundburg for decades, maybe hundreds of years, often in different incarnations. It is a drug den for the upper crust. Run by people several steps above the street-level crime syndicates like the Golden Triangle or the Canal Rats. People with real power, connected to the guard and the royal court. He asks the PCs to avenge her death. Real reason for the murder: Rose, early in her tenure at the House of the Red Door, saw a Board Member kill another employee in a drug-induced rage. She was killed by Blessed Balthasar and dumped in the canalization somewhere and washed up outside. If the PCs attempt Speak with Dead: Her friend Aubrey asked her to come along to the House of the Red Door–to work as a hostess, lots of money to be earned. They were brought there with hoods on, given some dust, everything was like a dream. They were spending the evening with an old nobleman who was there to consume some odd purple dust. During his drug haze, he attacked Aubrey and strangled her. Rose witnessed all of this and panicked. She started running through corridors of a big house, down some stairs, out into an alley. A large man was pursuing her. The last thing she remembers is a shadow closing in her her and large hands grasping her. 6.5.4 Murder Victim 4 3 days later, another victim is discovered. Young Half-Elf, Halimath Liadon. Lived in a boarding house with five other men. Crime scene: basement of the boarding house. Blood everywhere. Body is totally hacked apart. DC-12 Investigation check: hacked apart with a dagger, symbol carved in the body, dream dust residue on the face, bite marks, chunks eaten, cut out the lungs–they are missing. Very careless in comparison. Blood trail leads to a sewer grate. Witness 1: House matron: Halimath was a good guest, charming, worked as a bard–had a wealthy patron. Lady Uttermark, wife to Lord Uttermark, a wealthy nobleman, sits on the Board of Directors of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. Other witnesses: 2 house guests only recently moved in, didn’t know him well–he seemed polite. Didn’t hear anything during the night–all the guest rooms are on the second and third floor. One house guest knew him a bit better but their schedules didn’t overlap. He works as a temple cleric and has to get up early. He heard a noise in the middle of the night, like something falling to the ground. One older house guest is on a voyage, gone for 2 weeks already. Final witness is friends with Halimath, a gnome clockmaker apprentice. Persuasion DC-19 reveals that Halimath had an affair with Lady Uttermark. If the PCs want to question/investigate Lady Uttermark: they can easily find out that Lord Uttermark has a seat on the Board of Governors. PCs will not be allowed into the manor, the Lady is `sick’ (Lord Uttermark will have her removed). Following the bloody trail: leads into the sewers. PCs will find out: Sewers are controlled by the Canal Rats. E.g., patrols, monsters, and locked grates that they have the keys to. Canal Rat’s symbol is all over the sewers. PC realize the sewers are a great way of getting around the city. Local Canal Rat leader can confirm they were asked to help a man last night, opening gates for him, order came from the King–the Rat King. Find a homeless person (Burin) that got a quick look. Description: Very large man, muscular, wearing dark leather, long overcoat, had a mean looking knife in his hand. Open sores on the face, silver nose, tiny eyes, set deep into his skull Figure 6.2: The Sewers. Source: Encounters in the sewers: S1: Basement of the boarding house. The murder scene. S2: Secondary part of the basement. Abandoned storage area. Wet foot tracks can be spotted on the ground. Exit in the Sotuhwest is barred by an iron grate. Requires brute force or a thieves’ tools DC-20 check. S3: Vile stench coming from the pool of sewer refuse. 4 Troglodytes, 1-2 venom trolls are hiding under the surface. The S4: The eastern exit from S3 is blocked by a locked grate, DC-14 to open. Graffiti by the Canal Rats can be seen next to the grate. S5: 3 crossbow traps. S6: The refuge of Burin, a homeless dwarf monk and key witness. Currently not here. Obvious clues: clear signs that someone lives here. S7: Basement from another building, DC-20 doors, valuables worth 100 GP can be found here but belong to someone. S8: Ladder leads to another residence. Metal trapdoor opens to a lower level of the sewers with a strong current of water. S9: The room is trapped with a crossbow trap. S10: Private catacambs of a merchant family. Nothing scary here, except for some bones and valuables worth 13 GP. S11: 3 black puddings come through some floor grates when PCs linger in the area. S12: A necromancer’s hide-out. Opening the door requires a thieves’ tools DC-17 check. Inside, 1 Enchanter (Krauzor the Abominable!), 2 Ghasts, 3 Ghouls, 5 skeletons. Krauzor does not like visitors but can be bargained with (he always needs fresh bodies). Loot: 2 potions of greater healing, 1 potion of resistance. S13. Northern Entrance to the Canal Rat Hide-out. Blocked by an iron grate (DC-19), then traps S18: spiked, hidden pit trap (after the visible pit), rolling sphere trap (drops from ceiling), then another door at S17 DC-19 to go West. S14: DC-16 door to the room. Hidden spiked pit trap in the corner of the hallway. S15/S16: Main rooms of the Canal Rat Hide-out. At S15 a hidden spiked pit trap under the red carpet. Enemies: 5 wererats, 1 bugbear chief, and 2 bugbears. S19/20: Canal Rat lieutenant quarters. 5 wererats and 2 swashbucklers at the dining table.S20 1 master thief. The Master thief can reveal that the Canal Rats were ordered by their leader, the Rat King, to help the murderer navigate the canalization. He also knows the man’s name: Blessed Balthasar. S20: Falling portcullis trap that splits the party in the hallway. PCs trapped in the hallway will attract the Canal Rats. S21: Exit to a town square, barred by an iron grate (DC-16). S22: Burin’s current location. He is being attacked by a swarm of rats. He is hiding on top of the metal piping. If the PCs save him, he will first check on his 4 turtles and share some flatbread with them. He can tell them he saw the large man with a dagger, silver nose, and that he had the help of the Canal Rats–they have a hide-out to the West. He also knows the necromancer hiding in the West–he killed some of Burin’s friends. S23: The sarcophagos contains jewels worth 1000 GP and random major magic item, but also a Death Knight. Inscription reads: Here lies Aaron the Just, Knight of the Crimson Heart and Protector of Helsundburg. If disturbed, the Death Knight will rise and kill anyone who stole from his grave. S24: Boat dock. Access is blocked by a gate, DC-18. Corpse of a man that seemed to have lived here, murdered. Evidence suggests the murderer left the canalization here. Researching the large man/Master thief information: Old members of the Golden Triangle or old members of the guard will know the name `Bloody’ Balthasar. A murderer for hire, old-school, before the gangs were established. He killed for sport and liked it. Was sent to Skral Island years ago though. Also: left-handed. By now, the PCs should know that the murders are not simply the work of a demented serial killer, but are somehow connected to the election of the new Director-General of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. If they have collected all clues, they should know the following: There are 11 seats on the Board. Valeria Tallwater’s son will assume one seat on the Board of Governors. House Corwin controls three votes. Nobleman, Lord Victor Orenfell, that murdered the Aubrey in the House of the Red Door provides 1 vote (1 vote) Lord Uttermark provides 1 vote. That means the person behind Blessed Balthazar controls six of 11 votes. 6.6 Prison Break As the PCs are getting a break in the case wrt to Blessed Balthasar and the House of the Red Door, they hear from Captain Hemlock that there is news. Either Gregor or Captain hemlock informs the PCs that the killer got apprehended by the Order of the Crimson Heart. A witness saw a sketchy half-orc skulking about the merchant quarter. Informed a group of 3 Knights of the Order in the vicinity. The Knights apprehended the perpetrator as he was about to cut a woman. He is being held in a cell and has already confessed to the murders. This news angers Gregor, because it made him look incompetent and elevated the prestige of the Order of the Crimson Heart. The murderer is on the way to Skral Island. He can give them a quick summary of what the Knights determined. The perpetrator is a young Half-Orc dockworker, named Varg. Scrawny, looks a bit unhealthy. Knew details of each murder. If PCs ask: Not left-handed, no particular skill with bladed weapons. Whatever the PCs are saying, Gregor is finds this development too convenient. Varg is being moved to Skral Island until his execution. Vote on the new Director-General of the Merchant Bank is imminent. PCs need to go to Skral Island to talk with Varg and the Rat King to learn the truth. Skral Island is off the coast of Helsundburg, not technically part of the country. An extra-legal space with a Helsundian Garrison there. Many convicts are shipped there for prison labor. Usually, prisoners can be released after 20–40 years of work. Some are brought there for life. It is unusual to be brought there temporarily, before a trial has begun, but the Order of the Crimson Heart thought it prudent, given the threat posed by the murderer. The PCs will have to go to prison island under cover. Gregor can help them. The guards will let them in and out, but can’t help on the inside. PCs have to leave behind their gear, except for one non-weapon or armor item, e.g., spellcasting focus. A prison ship will take them. Figure 6.3: Skral Island. Source: Homemade On Skral Island: Objectives: learn about Bloody Balthasar, talk to Varg, talk to the Rat King. General description: North: Garrison and the Big Gatel. South: Canal Rat area West: Golden Triangle Area Northeast: Free Legion Central: Fish Market + the Weeping Arena. The prison South of the Big Gate is an open area. The prisoners have organized themselves into self-governed communities. They grow most of their own food, get some deliveries from the garrison, and have to deliver quotas of mined ore and foodstuffs. The Weeping Arena is run by one of the prison gangs. It is a privilege tolerated by the guards, because it keeps riots and violence against guards down. There is also a lot of betting going on that benefits the guards. The sea around the island is infested with monsters and dangerous currents. Helsundburg has somehow made this worse with magic. The waters are full of hunter sharks, giant octopi. The air is patrolled by Air Elementals. Available quests on the island: Arrival in prison: PCs arrive by boat with other convicts, 3 guys, one of which seems excited. They get a welcome speech from the Warden. Are then walked over to the Big Gate. Once you are on the other side, you are on your own. They walk through the gate with a cart full of supplies. When PCs reach a central square in the Fish Market Area, they see large groups of prisoners congregating–that’s when newbies get assessed by all the gangs. A prisoner will try to intimidate one of the PCs and threaten them physically. He wants one of the PCs personal items + he wants them to become slaves for his group–the Skeleton Crew (am assortment of bullies). PCs need to handle that threat. Gangs will approach them to join. If they don’t join a major gang, they can settle in in the Fish Market area. Local housing units organize work crews and sleeping arrangements. An old veteran offers them to join the Blue Fish House–one of the nicer groups. They can start working in the fields–which is backbreaking work. The houses cook communally. Finding Varg: In the Fish Market area, they can start asking questions about Varg. Persuasion/Intimidation DC-15 they learn that Varg has been put on work duty in a fish farm. Once they get to the fish farm, they see Varg on the docks, but are attacked by a group of Free Legionnaires. Their main goal is to kill Varg: 2 Bandit captains, 5 berserkers. Talking with Varg: Klausman used modify memory to implant a memory of the murders. Can’t be detected by Detect Magic, remove curse or greater restoration can remove it. Arcana DC-19 gives the knowledge of the spells existence. Varg is confused. He has the memories of the murders, but doesn’t know why. Figure 6.4: Fish Farm. Source: Homemade Acquiring weapons: clubs and daggers are fairly easy to come by. Anything else is highly restricted. They could trade healing/ goodberries. Asking about Bloody Balthasar: arena fighters and old prisoners will know about him. He ruled the Arena for 15 years, got his face burned off by acid in a fight with several Ankheg. Died about 5 years ago from some disease. Getting an audience with the Rat King: Gate guardian of the Canal Rats is Vasili (very tall, broad shoulders, top knot, shaved head, handlebar mustache, bare-chested). He has heard of the PCs (after the fight to protect Varg). He says they can’t just walk up to the Rat King. Need to earn the trust of the Canal Rats. Have to steal some supplies from the Free Legion compound. Have to sneak over the wall or get invited in. Beyond the wall, Free Legion members wear green arm bands. Supplies are in a guarded house (1 patrol, 2 guards on watch). It’s two sacks of tobacco. 2nd mission to show their trustworthiness: In the fish market, there is a healer, Ferghus Smallhand. We want him gone. Bring us his head. Background: Ferghus was a healer in a hospice, he had a penchant for poisoning innocent people. He is supplying the Free Legion with healing potions, toxins, and anti-toxin. If PCs object to cold-blooded murder, allow them to find a creative solution (e.g., maybe abducting him and stealing his stash). The Rat King will find their moral backbone interesting. Talking with the Rat King: They are being escorted from the gate into the community. Brought to a squat building, looks like a warehouse, escorted to the basement (filled with provisions). PCs need to leave their weapons and spell foci behind. They count a dozen guards in the building. Doubledoors lead to another level. He is a fat, blind wererat, lounging on a throne, dressed in skilk robes. The room is full of lush carpets, art, a table with a lot of food. The room is dark, the PCs can make out the eyes of many rats, lurking in the dark (hundreds). The Rat King is willing to listen to the PCs, pays particular attention if PCs were affected by the were curse when fighting the wererats in the Sewer Hide-out. The Rat King has a rivaling gang that runs the Weeping Arena (Golden Triangle). He wants the players to win the Weeping Tournament and he will tell them the truth about Balthasar. Figure 6.5: The Rat King’s Throne Room. Source: Homemade Information that can be gathered about the tournament: 7 rounds Golden triangle is in charge, only rule: survival Enemies are prisoners and beasts. Reigning champs are a set of half-brothers: Bashir and Tariq Saddiqqi–The Monster and the Claw. Golden Triangle has supposedly smuggled in a new beast–nobody has seen it. The Weeping Tournament: Available equipment: leather armor, daggers, clubs. For awesome kills they get thrown healing potions by the audience or better weapons. Round 1: 6 Wolves. New stuff: 2 shields, shortbow, 25 arrows, 2 handaxes, 1 spear, 1 shortsword, 1 greatclub, 1 whip, 1 net. Round 2: 1 Berserker, 1 spy, 8 bandits. Round 3: 1 Brown Bear, 1 giant scorpion, 1 giant boar, 1 giant hyena. Spikes are mounted on the whole arena wall. After Round 3, a short rest allowed. Give items: studded leather, healing potions, 2nd level spell scroll that fits. Round 4: They span a canopy across the arena to provide shade. 15 kobolds, 4 kobold inventors, 2 scale sorcerors, 4 dragonshields. The Kobolds come out of trap doors under the sand. Some trap doors open to become half cover, others close again and the ranged attackers can retreat into full cover. Additional spiked pit traps in the sand. Round 5: 1 Minotaur, 1 Manticore, 1 displacer beast. After Round 5, a short rest allowed. Give items: chain mail, appropriate weapons, healing potions, special potions (hill giant strength, potion of heroism), 2nd level spell scroll that fits. Round 6: A huge fire splits the arena. 5d8 fire damage on a failed DEX save to jump through, Beefed-up martial arts adept on one side, Gladiator (with indomitable, 2/per day, re-roll saving throws) on the other. Optional after Round 6: healing potions Round 7: T-Rex. Let the PCs take position in the arena. The crowd gets real quiet. They feel the ground shake as something large is approaching (play the Jurassic Park theme music. Use stats of a modified Spinosaurus (Tome of Beasts) with 2 Legendary Resistances, 150 HP, +10 to hit, slightly weaker damage (claw is 3d6+6, bite is 3d12+6), 3 Legendary actions: as in book + modified Tail Swipe (20 ft radius, DC-16 DEX ST, 1d8+8 or half, prone) or headbutt (+13 to hit, 3d6+6 bludgeoning and 15ft pushed back), charge (dash and bite attack), bite and throw (bite attack, thrown 30 ft, 4d6 bludgeoning damage, costs 2 actions). Figure 6.6: Weeping Arena. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop If the PCs are successful and win the Weeping Tournament, the Rat King will hold up his end of the bargain. If the PCs fail, they need to acquire the information from the Rat King some other way (he keeps a journal in his throne room). The Rat King’s information: He was approached by a powerful banker–Klausman Torfburg–10 years ago. He knew about Balthazar and arranged his “death” and extraction from the island. He approached him again last month about getting help from the Canal Rats–he offered a lot of money. The Rat King knows the location of the House of the Red Door–a former private residence in the merchant quarter. The house belonged to the Gustwind family–they fell on hard times and now the house is owned by the Helsundburg Merchant Bank, sitting empty. The PCs can get off the island by using the pre-arranged key-word with the guards at the Big Gate. If you think it’s fun, let this option fail and the PCs need to find their own way off the island. If the PCs are allied with Benoit, he will approach them on their return. He watched the arena fights and bet on their victory. He shares his winnings with them: 3000 GP. 6.7 The House of the Red Door The House of the Red Door is Klausman Torfburg’s headquarters. It is a secret drug den and Gentlemen’s Club for the upper crust of Helsundburg. Klausman uses it to gain leverage over important people in town, especially with regard to furthering his goal of gaining complete control of the Helsundburg Merchant Bank. General notes: All Guards and regular staff have their tongues cut out. All humanoid enemies in the House have additional Cultist abilities: Spore Kissed (poison damage in 10ft radius upon death equal to its hit dice, 2d8, immune to frightened and charmed), some can cast Ray of sickness, plant growth. To get the necessary evidence and confront Klausman, the PCs need to gain access to the second basement floor.

Source: Homemade The PCs can find Klausman’s notebook in this room: Notes on his correspondence with Mencius during his visit to Bracken. Personal notes on scheming the murders to attain the position of Director-General. Notes on his and Balthazar’s transformation–receiving Andromalion’s gift. Note about a large sum of money, embezzled from the bank, transferred to “The Matron” in Flowerdale. He notes how excited he is to support the Matron’s efforts to prepare a splendid offering to Andromalion during Midsommer. General allusions to putting things in place in Helsundburg for Midsommer. Loot: roll for random treasure. Balthazar’s Vicious Shortsword. It is also secretly Rinno’naggamon, the Soulrender, The Iron Duke’s Claw, forged by the Dark Blacksmith himself, Rin is a devil made flesh. The sword consumes the souls of every sentient creature killed with it. After 10 souls, it gains a +1 to attack and damage. At 30 souls it grants Misty Step once per day and adds 1d6 necrotic damage. At 200 kills, it can rend the fabric of reality (offers planeshift once per day), at 300 kills a +2 to hit and damage. At 1000 souls, it will grant 1 Wish. Any PC that attunes the weapon has to succeed on a DC-22 Will ST to put it down after attunement. A set of paintings on the walls: One for each cult member (stylized, shows them in what they want to be, titled with their codenames) and one of Andromalion (classic depiction). Same artist painted all paintings. Clue to the leader. Painting 1: The Herald (Mencius), individual preaching to a large group of people using the sun harp Painting 2: The Matron (the Lady Linnea), a women taking care of children Painting 3: The Guardian (Vraxa Redstar), a warrior protecting the flock against evil men Painting 4: The Stewart (Klausman), a man overseeing fields and workers, artisans All paintings show generic humanoids, very beautiful but with the same exact face and an ecstatic facial expression Main Painting: Obscured figure, painted under layers of greys and blues. Paintings 1-4 are arranged next to each other, Andromalion in the middle. Whoever looks at the painting for a while starts to see a clearer and clearer picture of Andromalion’s form, everybody sees a slightly different version, automatic paralyzation for 5 minutes and on a D20 even: frightened condition, odd: ecstatic/charmed condition. The other paintings also have effects, but only on the subjects of the paitings.They were a tool to draw each of them in. Artist’s name: Willard Tirebottom–Mencius’ real name. The PCs can investigate the name Willard Tirebottom and learn of Mencius’ past: They can learn he was a Bard student the Queen’s Academy 30+ years ago. Can find an old teacher. She remembers Mencius’ looks, his name back then was Willard Tirebottom. No talent, tried to be a painter, but very unimaginative, no great technical skills. Got kicked out of the college. She heard he changed his name a few years later and found a wealthy patron, actually a whole group of admirers. If Klausman is stopped, Marcus Lord Huntsilver becomes Director-General of the Merchant Bank. Balthazar is revealed as the murderer, but the scandal with Klausman is covered up by Gregor.

The shipment of live fungus from Bracken to Flowerdale, mentioned in Godefrey’s notes. PCs arrive and encounter an unnerving town that openly workships Anromalion. Investigating the Lady’s manor reveals that she is not present. PCs may find a local elven settlement and find one survivor that can point them to a nearby forest. PCs have to navigate a dangerous forest and discover the Canopy Gardens with the fungus farm. Confront the Matron and destroy the fungus farm. 7.2 Travel to Flowerdale Use the large regional map to manage travel to Flowerdale. The PCs might have to wrestle with randome encounters. 7.3 Flowerdale Figure 7.1: Flowerdale Region. Source: Homemade Figure 7.2: Flowerdale Town. Source: Homemade Information on Flowerdale that can be researched before arrival: A small county with maybe 15,000 citizens within the Kingdom of Helsundburg. The major settlement is Flowerdale (2,500 inhabitants). There are small number of outlying villages and the town of Oakbrook South of Flowerdale (1,000 inhabitants). The population consists mostly of humans and halflings. The economy focuses on agriculture, with a particualr focus on the growing flowers. Geography: Old Baglun Forest in the West is a dark and thick forest, Ferroglen Forest in the West is elven territory, the Golden Hills in the Southwest house many halfling burrows and orchards. The Flower Fields Southeast of Flowerdale are the center of farming and horticulture. The Malven River flows through Flowerdale. The regent of Flowerdale is Lady Linnea Halvermont. The Halvermont family has ruled Flowerdale for generations, even before the creation of the Kingdom of Helsundburg. Local traditions and customs have always been different from the rest of the kingdom. Other regions of the Kingdom consider Flowerdale a rural backwater. Flowerdale is protected by the Flowerguard, a militia with 50 full-time members and a larger number citizens that can be mobilized in times of need. There is a small elven settlement in Ferroglen Forest (Lorien in Elvish). 7.3.1 Arrival PCs see the amazing, colorful flower fields as they approach Flowerdale. Fields of asters in bloom. Lots of carriages and river barges. As the PCs are arriving in the town, a group of 12 children runs towards them and celebrate their arrival. They’ll ask a lot of questions: Where are you from? Why do you have a beard? What is that?. They are a mix of human and halfling children aged 5–13, healthy looking, grinning like crazy, wearing simple woolen clothing but in very good condition, flower wreaths in their hair. The town itself is colorful–houses are painted in bright colors and buildings are in great repair. The streets are bustling with regular activity. People are greeting each other on the streets. Notable details: People are very friendly, greet the PCs with huge smiles, the town is clean, everyone looks healthy, clean, and happy. The Flowerguard Militia wears a variety of armors but they all have very colorful cloaks. 7.3.2 The Town and Important Persons The Church: Located on the Northern end of the town square. Simple whitestone building, inside is kept clean and unadorned, stained glass windows in beautiful colors, central display is a vision of Andromalion. Two harps stand at the central altar. The Church congregation is led by Sister Mercy, a beautiful Tiefling woman with a brutal facial scar, wearing simple robes. She is the Hymnleader. Can explain that the town all worships together. It’s a simple religious community and they are no leaders. She arrived here 16 years ago, having been rejected all her live–was welcomed and joined the faith. She is the Hymnleader due to her musical talent. She can tell the PCs on a persuasion check that Lady Linnea brought the faith to Flowerdale after meeting a prophet of Andromalion nearly 20 years ago. Sister Mercy holds service once per day midday, Sundays is biggest meeting. Secret information: all local Church members are given living fungus that makes them particularly receptive to the teachings of the church. Guildhouse: The central guildhouse on the market square is an office building that deals with all local guild business: there are florists, bargemaster guild, teamsters, millers, smiths, carpenters, tanners, etc. The Guildhouse is run by Jasper Llewellynfyr, a male Half-Orc in his 50s, wearing a nice vest. He is a bargemaster and the elected guild overseer. He can tell the PCs about the commercial aspects of the town. They are looking for a new baker (Isa Othman–baker passed away from a fever recently, which is a rare event). They are also looking for a new smith–Rickard Stubblefoot, halfling–is getting up there in age and he wants to retire. Smithy: Rickard Stubblefoot runs the smithy with 4 apprentices. Mostly focused on farming equipment. Would like to retire soon and is looking for a master smith replacement. Healer and Herbalist: Janne Svensdottir, human female, 64 years old. Grey hair, wrinkled face. Can sell healing potions and antidotes. Magistrate’s Building: The local magistrate runs the town business from here. The current magistrate is Ula Widemarsh–a middle aged, matronly no-nonsense human woman. She collects taxes, organizes the market, maintains the town on behalf of Lady Linnea. Flowerguard Militia: The militia is led by Flower-Guardian Raif Mellameer–Ranger, human, 41-years old, brown hair, short beard, fine leather armor, longsword and bow. The militia has 50 full-time soldiers, 30 stationed in Flowerdale, 10 in Oakbrook, and 10 stationed across Flowerdale or patrolling. They can mobilize up to 150 militia fighters. The Spotted Pig: Local tavern, owned and operated by Willa and Willem Hillbark. The Goldriver Inn: Place to stay at affordable rates. Meekfoot’s General Goods: Owned and operated by Melvin Meekfoot and his halfling family. The Manor: Residence of Lady Linnea. Flowerguard bar entrance for visitors. The Lady is about to give birth (see Rumors and Events). 7.3.3 Events, Rumors, Investigations Passive perception 14: kids keep following the PCs around. They giggle and laug as they do. The Strangers: There is a group of strangers in town that plans to steal the lockbox from Melvin’s Goods. They will ride into town and storm Melvin’s during the PC’s first day. Townsfolk will alert the PCs, who might confront the thieves and become town heroes. Figure 7.3: Melvin’s. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Fight: Maimofex the Red Menace (Half-Red Dragon Veteran), 1 Orc Eye of Gruumsh, 4 Orcs, 2 Knights, 2 Scouts. Maimofex is a well-known regional bandit leader. After the fight, Raif will thanks the PCs, the whole town is extra welcoming. The Wedding: The town is set to celebrate a wedding the evening of the PC’s arrival. The PCs are invited. The groom is a member of the Flowerguard, the bride is the daughter of one of the bargmen. The wedding has a nice atmosphere, with a lot of singing and dancing, and good food. The PCs might spot that the bride is given elven jewelry (with inlaid amber) by the groom as a gift. PCs may notice other townsfolk with elven jewelry (with inlaid amber). Mass in the Church of Andromalion: PCs may want to observe a religious service. The congregation meets once per day at noon to sing. Simple 1 hour service. Sister Mercy has a beautiful voice, plays the harp well, the whole congregations gets an exalted look in their faces. Hymns are about Andromalion as a savior that brings eternal bliss and beauty. The Church preaches kindness and neighborly love. Eventually, the locals will try to make the PCs join the Church. This involves an induction ceremony with singing and the inductee having to eat some living mushroom. Sister Mercy keeps a golden ornamented box with active dream dust hidden in the altar. Sister Mercy feigns ignorance about the mushroom–she says she uses it for its light hallucinogenic effects to help the individual come closer to Andromalion. She says she bought them from a traveling alchemist. The Lady: PC might inquire about the Lady. Lady Linnea is well-loved and thought of as a just regent. She is a 45 years old human female. Her family has been in power for hundreds of years and the Lady for the last 30. Her husband died young in a hunting accident. She is a painter. Always wanted to children and now, finally, Andromalion has blessed her. She is pregnant and about to give birth. To keep her under strict observation, she is not receiving guests in her manor. She has a new advisor, Thyrodax Ironfang, a learned dragonborn and scholar that has arrived in town four months ago. He is not seen often outside the manor. In reality, Thyrodax is a wizard (Conjurer) that was hired by Lady Linea for her alchemical research on dream dust. The Offer: A NPC approaches the PCs–whomever they have had a good interaction with–and proposes the PCs settle down in town. Argues that they are needed. Start a family, live in peace. Goal is to make the PCs stay and join the Church. The Dancer: old man, dances outside his house and collapses in ecstasy. Sometimes he dreams of Andromalion and gets so happy, he just wants to dance. Asking about Yvenlorien: If the PCs get suspicious about the elven jewelry seen in town or just want to ask about the local elves, they hear something like this: We keep to ourselves but are friendly with the elves. Our farmers sometimes spot them at the edge of Ferroglen Forest. They never visit town. Why are you interested? You should stay here, they don’t like strangers, why don’t you come for dinner? Old Baglun: We never go there, it’s dangerous, full of monsters. Once some bugbears stole a child and the Flowerguard had to venture in there. That’s when Raif made a name for himself, he found the child and killed 4 bugbears. Stay away from there! Confrontations: Everybody is peaceful. If PCs get confrontational, locals give in. If PCs go too far, the town comes together and asks them to leave. Visiting the Manor: PCs may want to infiltrate the Manor. When the PCs are stalking around town at night, they may encounter locals (adults or children) that will try to sway them from walking around at night. Staff live in the town and are absent during the night. The road to the manor is guarded by four Flowerguards (2x Archer, 2x Veteran). Doors and windows are locked DC-21. The entrance to the wizard’s tower is locked with Arcane Lock Level-5. Figure 7.4: Mansion Level 1. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Figure 7.5: Mansion Level 2.

The new river barges are not currently moored in town. Wizard’s Tower: Thyrodax (Conjurer), a quasit familiar, and a Fire and Water Elemental. Thyrodax is a conjurer and alchemy expert. He was hired to help Lady Linnea refine the dream dust and got addicted in the process. Now, he feels captured and scared. He is willing to avoid a fight or will try to flee. The quasit is there to keep an eye on him and can command the Elementals. Magic items that can be found: a wizard’s spellbook, a modified Alchemical Compendium. It has the listed spells as well as Summon Abberation, Summon Construct, Create Homunculus. The book secretly it is Rinno’naggamon, Rin, a devil trapped in this book. The book can communicate telepathically with whoever attunes to it. At first, it has some spells. Rin will inform the PC that deeper secrets can be unlocked if the book is fed souls. Rin will pretend to be a simple magical spirit. PCs needs to use a Bonus Action to capture soul of a slain enemy (30ft range). After every 20 souls, the book adds new pages with more spells. After 77 souls, pages with Golem manual instructions appear (the pages vanish after Golem construction is completed). Eventually, a PC can trade 666 souls for 1 charge of summoning a pitfiend. Once the book is attuned, it takes a DC-22 Will save to break the attunement. PCs can also find 1 minor-uncommon, 2 minor-common magic items.

Gold and jewelry worth 600 GP. Enemies: Four Helmed Horrors. 7.4 Yvenlorien The PCs might want to visit the local elves at some point. Residents of Flowerdale will try their best to discourage them and distract them from their mission. History DC-20 or ask locals with a Persuasion DC-22: Yvenlorien is a small elven settlement, hidden in the Lorien forest. The elves are known to be shy and peaceful but also fierce protectors of nature. Have had mostly peaceful relations with others humanoids in the region. Known for their artisan skills in shaping wood and incorporating amber gem stones–they have a secret supply. 7.4.1 Finding Yvenlorien People are trying to stop them peacefully on the way. Involve them in conversation, invite them to dinner, ask them for help (broken down cart, damaged roof, injured husband). Within the Ferroglen Forest, PCs can try to find it. For regular PCs, 1 survival check per day DC-19, needs 3 successes. For elven PCs the DC-16. Each day and night there is a 25% chance of a random encounter (use standard encounter tables). 7.4.2 The Last Dirge of the Elves Figure 7.7: Yvenlorien. Source: Homemade Yvenlorien is a typical elven settlement: houses formed from living wood with magic, they have a shrine to Rillifane Rallathil (elven goddess of nature). Local custom: two flower boxes flanking each house entrance. Elves wear simple, but well-made woolen and leather clothing. The small elven settlement of Yvenlorien is currently devoid of life. The Lady tested the new amplified version of dream dust–called Andromalion’s Blessing–here. 60\\(+\\) innocent men, women, and children dead. Bodies are found throughout the small settlement. Investigating the bodies: Medicine DC-16, Investigation DC-16 They died of exhaustion or a heart attack, manic smile on their faces. Some of fungal growths on their bodies. As the PCs search the village, they won’t find anything valuable (all taken by the people of Flowerdale). After some investigation, the bodies begin to stir in haphazard motion and a fight: 60+ Zombies 1 corpseflower. This can get quickly overwhelming. The PCs have to use good strategy or try and retreat. The corpseflower is hiding behind a house and will try to surprise the PCs. 1 Survivor is hiding in the cellar of a building: the town drunk Quarion Cithreth. The settlement had a feast 3 days ago to see of a group of hunters and the town’s Paladin Veyriel off–they intended to go to the Old Baglun Forest to investigate some disturbing reports. Animals had reported to the village’s druid that parts of the forest had become more dangerous, infested with something dark and sinister. Quarion started drinking and went on a 2-day bender. When he woke up, he saw people starting to dance and laugh until they died. That was maybe five or six days ago. He has a foggy memory, there was something else that happened during his bender–Lesser restoration will help him remember another detail: he was sitting on the roof, marveling at the stars, drinking wine, when he saw a cloaked figure sneak into the village, towards the well. He was already drunk and thought he might have imagined it. He followed the figure toward the end of the village but couldn’t make out who it was. He can show them where the figure left the village–maybe they can still pick up a trail. Survival DC-20 points towards tracks that lead to Old Baglun Forest. Quarion will ask the PCs to find Veyriel in Old Baglun and tell her what happened. Quarion knows there is an old Gnome hermit–Yoikel Sneesnagg–that knows Old Baglun Forest best. He will know what’s going on. He is friendly if you bring him cheese. The Well: PCs can investigate the water.Alchemy, Poison, Investigation check, DC-17: evidence of modified dream dust. A large amount was dumped here–this requires quite the production as far as the PCs can tell. 7.5 Old Baglun Forest 7.5.1 Exploring Old Baglun Forest Navigating Old Baglun Forest is notoriously difficult. Thick forest growth, permanent fog, old magic that generates illusions that have let many a travelers get lost. Weird feeling of decay is present, fungal growth is seeping into the forest from below. PCs have four travel actions per day, but should use one to rest, otherwise they incur Exhaustion. They have to pick a direction to move: clockwise 1–6. Each moves requires a successful survival check against a varying DC (depending on weather and forest magic) roll D6 to determine the day’s DC: 1=10, 2=12, 3=16, 4=18, 5=20, 6=26. On a failed check, the PCs are moved in a random direction. The PCs can use 1 travel action to re-orient themselves. This requires a successful Survival check. Every night during a long rest, PCs may be randomly moved 2 hex squares away (8–10 on D10, roll D6 twice to determine direction). Magic protects the Canopy Gardens. PCs will be affected by the risk of losing their sense of direction and being moved randomly at night, unless they have Sneesnagg’s dowsing rod. With the rod, navigation becomes reliable and the rod points in the direction of the Canopy Gardens. Some squares have planned encounters (see below). Every day there is a 5% chance of a random encounter from the Forest Table in XGTE, this increases by 5% every day without an encounter. Track food and water! Animals will not talk to them (infected with the fungus). Figure 7.8: Old Baglun Forest. Source: Homemade Figure 7.9: Old Baglun Forest Event Areas. Source: Homemade Fixed locations and Events: Hermitage–small rock with the red flag. The crazed gnome hermit Yoikel Sneesnagg lives here. He will be accosted by some Pixies when the PCs arrive. The pixies will Polymorph him into a chicken. Without the PC’s intervention, the Pixies will keep torturing him. He will be reluctant to help unless the PCs can succeed on a Persuasion DC-20 (DC-16 if they give him cheese). He can offer them refuge (mushroom soup!) and can point them to the location of the Canopy Gardens. This is where he thinks something is going on. He can give the PCs a Dowsing Rod that can lead them there. Note: if the PCs several harm one of the pixies, see Dealing with the Fey. Figure 7.10: Yoikel’s Hermitage. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Bugbear bandit hide-out–Big rock formation in the West. Hideout: outside guards are 2 Bugbears and 2 Bugbear Archers. First level: 4 Bugbear Brutes, 1 Bugbear Hunter, 2 Bugbear Archers, 2 Bugbear Warriors, Bugbear Shaman. Bugbears in the far right room have access to a secret tunnel they can use to double-back and ambush any intruders from the outside. Second level: 1 Bugbear Shaman, 1 Bugbear Champion of Hggruk, 2 Bugbear Warriors, 2 Bugbear Ambushers. Treasure in the hideout: Hggruk’s Throwing Axe (+1 hand axe returns after each throw), Bag of Holding, +2 minor-uncommon, 2 minor-common. Figure 7.11: Bugbear Hide-out Level 1.

Others need to help with a STR check DC-18 to pull the PC out. The grungs worship the Froghemoth as a god. They liked to sacrifice outsiders to their god but can be bargained with. They are aware of the growing dangers in the forest and are unhappy about it. Figure 7.13: Northern Swamp. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Western Swamp: 5 trolls. Some parts of the ground are sinkholes.

Remains of the elven hunting party, led by the palading Veyriel. Elves were not killed by the undead but by an ambush team from Flowerdale. Their bodies attracted the undead. If the PCs discover the bodies at night, there will be an attack by undead: 1 Banshee, 3 Wights, 3 Shadows. Treasure that can be found: 1 minor-uncommon. 1 night ambush–determine randomly. Raif Mellameer (Champion with Ranger features like sharpshooter}, 4 Flower Guards (Veterans), 2 Archers (with sharpshooter). They’ll approach with Pass Without a Trace and try to get a surprise attack. They will target specific PCs to kill, i.e., attack even if a PC goes to zero. Mencius’ dream invasion: at an increasing rate, Mencius will invade the PCs dreams to terrorize them. PCs will be confronted with a variety of dream scenarios (see below for examples), building on their back stories. PCs need to do a WIS ST DC-16. Regular failure: 1 level of exhaustion \\(+\\) roll a d6 that is the number of spell slot levels that do not recover (half of that for half-casters, i.e., a rolled 3 means 2 level 1 and 1 level-2 do not recover), a roll of 10 or more points below the DC means no long rest benefits and 2 levels of exhaustion. PC back in their home village. Everyone is dead around them, struck down by disease. But they noticed their faces are smiling, their dead eyes look ecstatic. Suddenly they speak to him: We are now with him, he saved our souls, come join us, we need you, we are so happy, all hail to Andromalion. In the end, the whole village is singing a song to praise Andromalion. Cleric PC is back in their old village. Exhausted after a hard day of caring for the sick. Everyone has the fever. They are happy though because their family has been spared so far. Returns home, their kids greet them. They are very excited–they have a surprise for them: Mom has the fever and Andromalion will taker her soon! She has the manic grin. Kids say Andromalion will come for them too. Why won’t you join us, don’t you love us? In an empty building, long corridor, several doors. PC hears a faint voice calling for their help. They realize it their brother. Perception checks to follow the voice. They have to break down doors. Eventually, they find their brother, on a bed, looking very sickly. He reaches out to them and asks: Why didn’t you help me? Why weren’t you there when I needed you? His skin starts to undulate and worms break through and he dies in the PC’s arms. Back in their village, they are young. A typical work morning in their profession. Their fellow apprentices are joking with them, talking about the dance tonight. They are asking her/him whether they think `he’ will ask them to marry them tonight? They say he is a good match, beautiful, a pious man, and truly in love with them. Then the scene shifts to them preparing for the evening–The PC has put on a nice outfit. At the dance, they look expectantly for their love interest. They spot them in the middle of the dance floor. The person turns around and it is Mencius. But instead of feeling revolted, they are overcome with a deep feeling of love and happiness. Mencius greets them and kisses them. 7.6 The Canopy Gardens Figure 7.15: Canopy Gardens. Source: Homemade The Canopy Gardens are a forest dungeon. Twisted trees and thick brush form hallways, tunnels, and caves. The canopy of the trees blocks all sunlight. The air is thick of flowery and earthy smells. Mosquitos and other insects are buzzing about. The regular vine barriers require attacks with slashing damage or fire to get through, immune to piercing, resistant to bludgeoning. They have AC-14 and 20 HP. You can try to look through them but it is difficult, i.e., heavily obscured. Mushroom areas have dead bodies strewn around, weird mushrooms growing through them. This is were new the Underdark mushroom is grown to produce more dream dust. The dead bodies are used as fertilizer. CG1: Growing area. 2 Deathcap Myconids, 8 Vine Blights. CG2: 8 Gas spores, 4 Violet Fungi, CG3: 1 Deathcap Myconid tending to fungi-corpses. CG4: dead body of an elven ranger, an amulet worth 140 GP, 1 healing potion. CG6: 2 Shambling Mounds squeeze out of the tree growth behind the PCs, cutting them off. 6 Vine Blights emerge out of the thick brush. In the Shambling Mounds, the PCs can find remains of several humanoids, valuables worth 430 GP. CG5: A corpse with a sack of potions (random mix). CG7: Vine trap. DEX ST DC-16, on a failed save PC is restrained and being drawn into the wall, takes 2d4 piercing damage from thorns and will start suffocating. Other PCs can helps by attacking the vines, AC-12, HP 50 to free one PC. CG8: This were new fungus is brought and dried for further processing. 2 Spawn of Kyuss, 1 Deathcap Myconid, 4 Vine Blights on guard. Combat noises will alarm monsters in area CG9 and start a countdown until the river barge leaves. The PCs have 8 rounds before the the two remaing barges leave. CG9: Vines blocking access have AC-14, 100 HP (resistant to bludgeoning, immune to piercing). 2 Cult Fanatics, 6 Cultists, 1 Bandit Lord, 2 Archers. Ships are loaded with Andromalion’s Blessing in a hidden compartment. flowers are the regular cargo. The hidden compartment also contains bribe money of 3,000 GP. CG10: Lady Linnea’s sanctum. Lady Linnea is a Spore Druid that has been working on refining dreram dust into Andromalion’s Blessing. She has already produced one shipment and sent it to Helsundburg. Two more barges are being loaded. Use the stats of an Arch Druid with some special abilities: She can shapechange into a Fleshpod Hornet. Lady Linnea has a Spore Druid aura: any creature within 10 ft of her can be dealt 1d10 damage with a reaction at the start of their turn (CON ST against her spell save DC). Legendary Resistances 2x. Lady Linnea has a legendary action to cast a cantrip, shapechange, or cast a healing spell. She will start combat by upcasting heat metal on a PC. The Child (malformed, skin is a patchwork of soft, white baby skin and brown, thick leather, a vertical eye, other empty and oozing, one arm ends in a mouth, a scorpion stinger on the back). A gift from Andromalion. She is holding her baby, covered in blankets. Use stats of a Spawn of Akyshigal. Has a climb speed (will go up the canopy). Legendary Resistances 2x. The Child has a legendary action to create or command a swarm of insects. As long as one of them is alive, there is a lair action: Vines will sprout from the ground randomly and ensnare/restrain 1 PC (DC-15 DEX ST), vines can be escaped every round with a DEX or STR ST or by attacking the vines (AC-12, 15 HP). -Additional monsters: 1 Cult fanatic spellcaster/lab assistant. Uses spiritual weapon, then hold person, consider command and inflict wounds. If there is a TPK, Mencius/Lady Linnea will revive the PCs and put a Geas on them: retrieve the shard from Mountains of Madness. Loot in Lady Linea’s personal laboratory: Alchemical notebook: Lady Linnea’s personal research notes. PCs can learn that simple dream dust is made from dead fungus. Can be diluted to generate effects as in the House of the Red Door. Members of the church are regularly given living fungus to fester inside of them–ties them more closely to the Church, helps them keep secrets, allows Lady Linnea to affect their emotions. Notes mention Klausman’s experiments with dream dust and how he made his staff compliant, but not potent enough for their purposes. Notes then describe her research on amplifying *dream dust8. She hired a alchemical specialist to help her (Thyrodax). She developed Andromalion’s Blessing, which is dramatically more potent: causes extreme ecstasy, visions, and hallucinations, uncontrolled laughter and dancing–most subjects died in the end. Notes describe the results from the test on the elven village. Ingredient and supply list: Lady Linnea had enough material for three ship loads of Andromalion’s Blessing. Shipping notes: 1 large shipment has been sent weeks ago (no details on to where, but her notebook mentions her other journal, which is in the mansion). Shipment is meant for next Midsommer, to prepare the offering for Andromalion. Treasure: 1 major-uncommon, 4 minor-common, eldritch claw tattoo, longbow +1 (from the elven village), +1 moon sickle. 7.7 Dealing with the Fey If the PCs attacked the pixies: A Pixie emissary arrives with a message for the attackers. The Wild Hunt has been called and you are its quarry. The Lord of the Hunt will send hunting parties for them–it does not stop! Every future encounter, there is a random chance a fey hunting party appears as well and targets them (20 on 1D20). They can try to consult with a neutral fey, scholar, or expert to learn about the Wild Hunt. The hunt can be called off if he can offer something of equal value in a parlay. When encountering a hunting party, they need to utter an old Sylvan phrase to invoke the parlay. Rough translation: By the warm touch of summer and the cold embrace of winter, by hope of spring and the harvest of fall, I hereby invoke the old laws of the Fey Courts. Show me my accuser and let me enter a binding contest of wills. If they don’t speak Sylvan, they need to do an INT DC-17 check to say the words exactly right. On a success, the Fey will honor the request for parlay and escort them to a Feywild Gate (opened via a magical feather) and bring them to a meeting place. PCs might know/guess that the pixie probably returned to the Feywild upon `death’ and thus wasn’t technically permanently killed (The Faerie was reborn as a massive Fomorian and will come to punish them). Ranger friends can tell them about Fey weaknesses/strengths: cold iron, resistance to magic. First Fey hunt team sets an ambush: Several Red Caps (regular and special from the Tome of Beasts) and a Fey Huntress: Thornwalker–Huntress of the Deepwood Vale (elven features, long, white hair, reaching to the ground, clothed in leaves and thorns, holding a bow made from bone, black eyes). Stats: 3 redcaps, 1 redcap leader, 1 summer Eladrin (longbow damage: 2d8+5 piercing and 3d8 psychic, can cast greater invisibility twice a day). Parlay: PCs can meet the Fey on neutral ground and negotiate the Weregeld. Lord of the Hunt will preside. A little gnarled tree creature will be their translator and representative. Let the PCs come up with some ideas for possible bargains. Here are some suggestions: A duel to death. Offending character against the Pixie (The PCs don’t know the Pixie has re-formed as a Fomorian). This is to the death. No resurrection by others. PC can offer a child. If the PC is male, they need to sleep with the Fomorian and sire their offspring A sacrifice: The PC needs to sacrifice something valuable, e.g., the bow arm of a ranger, their eyesight, their dexterity, their subclass (e.g., become a Fey Wanderer), the ability to feel a certain emotion, memories.

The PCs learn more about Shargak during their travels and meet Orin Stoutale, and Osswald the Long on the way. Orin is on the way to Rumnahold to petition for support from the Rumnaheim Society. The PCs receive an audience with Gilthur Goblinbane and petition for researching the ancestral archives. They are sent on a quest to retrieve the hammer of Durin Silverbeard, the Sunforged Hammer of Dwarven Might, and the shard carried by Torgga Wyrmstalker. Start of the expedition: Kathra Orcfoe, Orin Stoutale, and Osswald the Long and his demon-goat Fred and the PCs. Kathra will push for risky actions. Mencius will be racing them for the shard (he has a fungal clone as a backup). Because of the flesh component for Clone, perceptive PCs can spot that Mencius us missing 2 fingers on his right hand. He is accompanied by a team of elite Doppelgangers, 1 Death Knight (a resurrected member of Durin’s warparty, Raugrim Blackshield). Theyare hunting the shard and have a head start. They know which way to go and are in possession of a dwarven runestone that helps them deactivate various war machines. The PCs eventually will reach Drowblood Bridge. If Mencius has arrived before them, his Death Knight blocks the bridge and he has passed through the Drow Gate and sealed it. If the PCs arrive before Mencius, they can advance to the Temple with a head start. With a closed Drow Gate, the PCs can try to unseal the gate or take a detour through Moradin’s Way. Along that alternative path they are likely to encounter an several Underdark menaces. Eventually, Mencius and the PCs will arrive at the Drow Temple. If Mencius arrives first, he makes a deal with the local Drow Priestess and gains access to the sanctum. If the PCs arrive first they can force the Drow out or make a deal with them themselves, while Mencius will attempt an attack during their foray into the temple sanctum. 8.2 Travel to Rumnahold Benoit can tell the PCs that his family’s records indicate one shard was given to a family friend–a dwarven explorer and adventurer of the name Torgga Wyrmstalker, based in Rumnahold. He can also update the PCs that he is pursuing a rumor of a banishment ritual. His brother Gregor is doing their best to uncover the remaining network of the Church of Andromalion in Helsundburg. He can also host them for a night and then arrange passage to Rumnahold. On the road, the PC meet Orin Stoutale (statistics of a Priest but has taken a vow of non-violence, 15 AC and 35 HP) and the dwarf ranger Osswald the Long (stats of an Archer with a light crossbow, Fred has the stats of a Giant Goat with AC 14 and 30 HP but can cast Firebolt) and a few fellow dwarven travelers. Their carriage has broken down and they could use some help. On the carriage is a cage with a Goblin prisoner. Orin is traveling to Rumnahold for an audience with Gilthur Goblinbane–the leader of the Rumnaheim society. He wants his help in defending Bracken against the rising Goblin threat. Bracken has been doing well were it not for the constant raids by Goblins on outlying farms and merchant carriages. Osswald can confirm that the Goblins are operating out of the Tallwood. The forest has become very dangerous and outsiders enter at the risk of their lives. He used to stroll the woods extensively and but not anymore. Shargak seems to have found allies among the darker forces of the Tallwood. Orin has with him a prisoner–a Herald of Shargak. He brought him to make his case to Gilthur Goblinbane. His name is Borgsnozzle, he is a scrawny Goblin, wearing a white, tattered nightshift, blind on one eye, wears a jester cap. Borgsnozzle will be defiant at first but can be coaxed into talking and boasting about Shargak, e.g., by plying him with alcohol or food or goading him (appropriate skill checks). The Legend of Shargak, as told by a Herald of Nilbog: 17 years ago, he was born during midwinter in the Tallwood, a small goblin child, sickly, one of five. His family sold him to three hags in exchange for food. The hags made him work hard every day, beat him, played tricks on him, made him empty their chamber pots. Often he prayed for help, but Maglubyiet is unforgiving and cruel. In his deepest days of desperation he often thought about ending his life, but one night, he heard a voice–whispering to him that he was destined for more. He started to observe the hags, learn their cunning tricks. One night, during a difficult ritual, he pushed the hags into a big cauldron and stole their dark magicks. He then wandered the lands, learning about the ways of goblin, bugbear, hobgoblin–how the Hobgoblins had enslaved the goblins. During his travels, the voice called out to him again, leading him to an old cave where he found a magic glass shard in a cave–the Shard of Truth. The shard revealed to him the truth–that Maglubyiet is a dark and corrupting influence on goblinkind, a usurper god. The truth shard connected him to a lost deity of the Goblins–Andromalion the Redeemer. Using the power of the shard, Shargak could show other goblins the truth about Maglubyiet. He gathered followers around him to upend the tyranny of the hobgoblins, liberate all goblins, and make them sing the song of freedom. Many months later, a vile group of humanoid adventurers, sent by Maglubyiet, captured him and took the truth shard from him. He was thrown into a dark and cold prison cell in the town of Bracken–a vile, festering postule on the face of the earth, where they eat baby goblins and roast Bugbears. They tortured him for days and sentenced him to death. In this time of dire need, he spoke a prayer to Andromalion. The next day, in front the the jeering masses there to watch his execution, Andromalion answered his prayer and sent him the power to transform himself, allowing him to escape the dim humans and dwarfs. Without the truth shard, he went on a spirit quest to learn a different way of exposing the lies of Maglubyiet and liberate his fellow goblin folk by telling the truth of Andromalion. After wandering for 42 days in the mountains, Andromalion blessed him with a holy aura and gave him a mission: He will create a new goblin kingdom, bring civilization, goblin equality, reclaim the lost shard, and remove the influence of Maglubyiet. He will exact justice on the town of Bracken as well! He is gathering followers all across the land, uniting the tribes. He is the Chosen of Andromalion, the secret Goblin god, sent to upend the order of Maglubyiet—the Age of Goblins is Coming!! Gragnug (Liberty)! Ortug (Equality)! Pagnung (Fraternity)! 8.3 Arrival in Rumnahold: Figure 8.1: Rumnahold. Source: Rumnahold is a settlement of about 5,000 humans and 4,000 dwarfs. The topc ity is ruled by a council of merchant families. Rumanold proper is the underground dwarven city, ruled by King Irri Broadbeard. The Rumnaheim Society is an important faction in town, vying for dominance. Notable locations: Archive of the Fathers and Mothers of the Mountain (Headquarters of the Rumnaheim Society) Hall of Forges: A central underground square for all the blacksmiths. Orin can provide the PCs with a housing arrangement through the Rumnaheimn Society in their guest house. 8.4 Investigating Torgga Wyrmstalker Asking around town. PCs can ask around Rumnahiem for the name Wyrmstalker but there is no clan of that name (some may remember that name dimly, not humans though). Torgga was not originally from Rumnaheim, only lived here for a while and kept a low profile within the city. She was known in certain circles dealing with adventuring. Social roll DC-12 to reveal people have heard of the name and that she was a non-local adventurer. Orin can help the PCs learn that the Rumnaheim Society keeps detailed clan records for dwarfs in their Archive of the Fathers and Mothers of the Mountain. Orin can access this, dwarfs are allowed to enter, non-dwarfs are given a hard time (Social roll DC-18). Orin is willing to help if the PCs will support him in his request. Research in the Archive. PCs should do an Investigation roll (if others aid, give Advantage). &lt; DC10 research takes 7 days, DC10-15 research takes 4 days, DC16-20 3 days, DC 21-22 2 days, DC over 22 1 day. Records of Torgga: she was a skilled explorer and adventurer that lived in Rumnaheim. The last mention of her is being part of a Crusade by Durin Silverbeard. He was a famed warrior, explorer and hero. Lived to the age of 413. The Rumnaheim society was founded in the wake of his death, he is considered an Ancestor of the Deep (like a saint). Durin headed an expedition to the Underdark to claim a holy site–Graumagyr–which had been converted into a Drow temple (The Shrine of Jhaelrynna). The expedition got lost in the Underdark and was never heard from again. They find a mural in the Hall of Ancestors of the expedition members: Durin Silverbeard in the middle (hammer in one hand, foaming magical tankard in the other, mighty silver beard), Raugrim Blackshield on the right (surly, heavily armored dwarf, black beard, black shield), The Brothers Braumann–Hurn and Harn (a famed artificer and a cleric), Torgga Wyrmstalker (strawblonde hair, fine leather armor and a pendant made of a glass shard). They were accompanied by 40 more dwarven warriors. Durin’s Sunforged Hammer of Dwarven Might is considered a lost relic. Details on the travel route of the expedition are under lock and key of the Rumnaheim Society. PCs need an audience with Gilthur Goblinbane Meeting Gilthur Goblinbane I: Gilthur is an old, but still impressive dwarf. A long blond beard with some grey, battle scars on his face, muscular build. Exudes old man strength despite is massive belly. A big axe leans next to his throne. Gilthur is a warpriest that has fought in many wars against Orcs, goblins, Duergar, and Drow. He founded the Rumnaheim society 150 years ago to preserve dwarven traditions and heritage, give voice to dwarven interests and the `Olden Ways’. He hates Orcs, goblins, Drow, he is skeptical of humans and elves. Halflings and gnomes he considers non-threatening. He is vainglorious and he strives for more power and recognition. If he had his way, he would rule Rumnaheim and then further unite all dwarfs under the banner of the Rumnaheim Society. PCs need to convince Gilthur to let the PCs go look for Durin and the shard and/or send help to Bracken. Gilthur is skeptical about both requests. Wrt to Bracken, he does not like sending dwarfs above ground (but likes the idea of a re-newed Rummnaheim Society spreading dwarf values and fighting goblins). He is also skeptical about the expedition because he doesn’t like the idea of non-dwarfs finding the remains of Durin or recovering is famous Hammer. But he is secretly eager to reclaim the Hammer for himself. If the PCs suggest members of the Rumnaheim society should accompany them, he will jump on that. Otherwise, he will eventually suggest it himself. Negotiation over the number of companions. They are being accompanied by Orin (optional), Osswald, and Kathra. Small group is deemed best, to attract less attention. Kathra Orcfoe is a grizzled dwarfen fighter (stats of a Graveslayer, CC). She is instructed to push the group hard, take risks to attain glory and make sure to secure the hammer for dwarvenkind (and the Rumnaheim society). She will risk the PCs lifes without question. Background on Kathra: An orphan (parents died in a mining accident), she was raised by the Rumnaheim Society. Early on joined the special order of the Graveslayers–warriors that protect the ancestors. A group of dour, serious paladins and knights. She is a woman of few words but competent. 8.5 Preparing the Expedition PCs will have to venture to the Underdark. Durin’s travel plan: 1) reach Rustmark’s Redoubt (a series of fortified tunnels and battlements that was once a front line in the battle against the Drow–think WWI trench warfare), takes 8 days of underground travel to get there, official entrance to the Underdark proper. Currently no-man’s land; 2) Drowblood Bridge (a massive stone bridge that spans a wide chasm, leads to Drowblood Gate. Drowblood Gate was the frontline fortification of the Drow against Dwarven incursions. Through Drowblood Gate 3 days travel to Graumagyr, the site of a holy shrine to Moradin. Was captured by Drow hundreds of years ago and turned into the Shrine of Jhaelrynna, consecrated to Lolth–Jhaelrynna was a powerful priestess of Lolth. During tried to recapture the site for the dwarfs. This was 130 years ago. Since the, the Drow have retreated due to a Drow civil war but nobody has claimed the territory–it is in the zone of influence of the Drow. Gilthur is angry at the leaders of Rumnahold for not having reclaimed this region sooner. PCs should prep for 30 days of travel. 8.6 Reaching Drowblood Bridge Hex crawl rules: PC begin in Hex 0101 Only the surrounding hexes are visible. GM should provide some hints (smells, sounds, etc.) to help PCs choose direction. Each group has 4 travel actions per day (6 hours each): Move to another hex Push Take either two Move or 1 Move and 1 Explore action. Incurs 1 level of exhaustion. Explore current hex. Reveals local sight or a roll on the treasure table. Short Rest fulfills daily sleep requirement, benefits of a short rest. Long Rest takes two travel actions. 12 hours are needed to prepare a camp, supplies, and dealing with environmental hazards. Each day without a Short Rest or Long Rest incurs 1 level of exhaustion. Every other travel action, roll the Encounter Table. Mencius begins in Hex 0602. Mencius has a dwarven runestone that let’s him safely pass any Clockwork Myrmidons and roughly knows the way. Randomize direction between Western and Southwestern path. Mencius will only short rest. Upon arrival at the bridge, Mencius takes 1 Short Rest Action and then spends 8+2d4 travel actions to open the gate at Drowblood Bridge, pass, and seal it again. This implies an average of 14 actions for Mencius to pass Drowblood Bridge. PCs will need 25-30 actions to reach Drowblood Bridge, less then 20 if they push a lot and get lucky. 8.6.1 Hex Descriptions Figure 8.2: Rumnahold.

Party is traveling through this region to deliver potions and some scrolls, held on a little strongbox two of the Derro are carrying. They are very cautious and mistrusting. History DC-14 identifies them as dwarfkin, blue-skinned Underdark folk. Known to me vicious, mad, and groveling to more powerful creatures. Afflicted by intense paranoia and have sorcerous powers. They only speak Undercommon. If attacked, they will try to run and ambush the PCs later (accompanied by a Derro Shadow Anti-paladin and a Dogmole Juggernaut). The Derro can be convinced to trade some of their goods for weapons/magic items. They can tell the PCs about Drow patrols in this region (range in size from 4-10, some are accompanied by Shadowblades), they can also reveal that Drow activity has increased around the abandoned Shrine. Drow patrol. 4 Drow, 1 Drow Elite Warriors (moving at a distance and hidden). Elite Drow patrol. 4 Drow, 3 Drow Elite Warriors, and 1 Drow Shadowblade (moving at a distance and hidden). Fire Myrmidon in a fox hole: Elemental Myrmidons (used as war machines in past conflicts, they attack anything within a certain radius). Entrance area, South of the barricade: PCs find a dead Drow patrol (4 dead, stripped of provisions), Perception DC-16 reveals lingering pleasant smell (PCs that had a dream with Mencius can identify him). Survival check DC-18 (group of PC party-size humanoids +1, 1 heavily armored dwarf.). Tracks get muddled not too far away but maybe only a day old? The Dark Pond: 2 Cavelight Moss and 1 hidden Neothelid in the water. To the east of the pond, there is acid sludge on the ground and several bleached skeletons. A nature or medicine check reveals the sludge to be digestive fluid. 1 dwarven skeleton is on the cavelight moss next to the water, one dwarven skeleton is on a stone in the water. They are the remains of Hurn and Harn Braumann (Perception DC-14 to identify their gear). The body on the water has a dwarven rune key lying next to it. The rune says ``sleep’’ (turns the Clockwork Myrmidons off). Clockwork Myrmidon Gauntlet: 7 Clockwork Myrmidons are blocking the way to the Drowblood Bridge. Visible dwarven runes on their armor. Arcana DC-17 and History DC-18 (15 for dwarfs) can reveal that these are old war machines of the dwarfs that are protecting the area. Runes say things like Attack'',Guard’‘, Follow'',Sleep’‘. The ``Guard’’ rune is lit up. You need a Rune Key to make them stand down / adjust their behavior. Figure 8.4: Clockwork Gauntlet. Source: Homemade Mencius: Mencius, accompanied by several elite Doppelgangers and 1 Death Knight. 8.7 The Battle at Drowblood Bridge Figure 8.5: Drowblood Bridge. Source: Homemade PCs arrive at the bridge and see a group of humans vanish through the gates. Perception DC-16: they see a glimmer of long, blond hair. A single dwarf stands to block the other side of the bridge. Big fight on the bridge: Death Knight (Raugrim Blackshield). Death Knight has the Sentinel feat, axe and shield, 1 Legendary Action: single attack. Final attack option for the Dwarf Death Knight: grapple a PC and jump off the bridge into the lava: 90ft fall does 9d6 damage, 6d10 fire damage in the lava per round. Other enemies: 8 Skeleton Archers with longbows cover the far side of the bridge, Ogre skeleton (stats of a Giant Skeleton rises behind the party. They are trying to cover Mencius’ advance. The aftermath: Doors are locked DC-20. Inside they find Drowblood Gate–locked via ancient Drow rune magic (similar to Mordenkainen’s Private Sanctum). Bars teleportation, opening etc. It would take ten successful castings of Dispel Magic against a level-4 spell and Arcana checks to undo the sealing. Alternatively, Shape Stone could also work, but would take 10+ castings. Gate is blocked by a puzzle. PCs can try to solve the puzzle or go through Moradin’s Way. Puzzle: In the center of the gate is a mural of a spider. Five cylinders with Drow runes. Each cylinder can be turned to show the Drow numerals for 0-9. Above each cylinder a letter is etched into the stone. The cylinders spell out: L-O-L-T-H. Around the arch of the gate, six words are displayed: Thorn, Night, Hate, Venom, Mother, Glutton. Reveal this if PCs are looking around (no check needed): On the ground, etched into the stone floor: ``You must separate the parts that make the whole. Pile like to like, only then will you pass. Four is all you need.’’ Four clues: There are 6 made of 32. 13 like piles. Four numbers is all you need. Counting each pile is all you need. Old clues: There are 6 made of 32. First, you must separate., Put them into 13 like Piles. Only then will you escape the vile., Four Numbers are all you need. Counting each Pile is the key.. Solution: 6 words with 32 letters. Count up the letters: A:1, E:3, G:2, H:4, I:1, L:1, M:2, N:4, O:4, R:2, T:6, U:1, V:1. Pick the numbers 1, 4, 1, 6, 4 to spell out L-O-L-T-H on the cylinders. Orin can tell them about Moradin’s Way. THIS CAN BE BYPASSED if PCs have a good idea. Moradin’s Way will lead them to the Shrine from the other side. Moradin’s Way is quicker but more dangerous (i.e., they can long-rest). 8.8 Detour Through Moradin’s Way Figure 8.6: Moradin’s Way. Source: Homemade Encounters: Dark sludge pit: 4 Tar Oozes–can be avoided if PCs don’t step into the sludge and stealth around. Path north: Long blond hair of Mencius and a trail in the dusty ground–the Balhannoth creates an illusion to lure the PCs in. Webbed area: Ghostwalk Spider and 4 Giant spiders. Second sludge area: 8 Intellect Devourers. 8.8.1 Lair of the Balhannoth Figure 8.7: Lair of the Balhannoth. Source: Homemade As the PCs get closer, the Balhannoth uses its lair action to target one PC (randomly). DC-16 Will ST or the target teleports to the center of the lair, the Balhannoth will be invisible to the target until it attacks. PC will see the body of Durin with his hammer and next to him Torgga on the ground. Then the Balhannoth will attack. Other PCs will have to race after their friend. Combat tactics: ambush single target, grapple, bite. When the others show up, Balhannoth can teleport with legendary actions. Emergency: use lair action with DC-16 Will save to teleport a pesky enemy away! Optional loot: A control rune key or a powerful magic item. 8.9 The Shrine of Jhaelrynna Figure 8.8: The Temple. Source: Homemade Drysimma and her group have been trying to enter the shrine and were surprised by Mencius’ attack. The PCs can attack her and her group or try to negotiate with her. She wants to undo the magical barrier and claim the site. A possible deal could be reached if the PCs are willing to take the hammer/shard in exchange for abandoning the site. Kathra will not be convinced by this and fight to death to stop this deal. Drysimma may or may not renege on the deal once the PCs have destroyed the barrier but it is entirely possible for her to honor the agreement, depending on how the negotiations went. When approaching the Temple, PCs can find various tracks, indicating a fair amount of movement (Drow patrols, Drow traders, Derro and Duergar trada caravan’s). Drop hints that peaceful trade has been happening in this area to at least suggest a non-aggressive initial approach. There is a waystone not too far from the temple that indicates directions to Duergar and Drow cities, Derro camps, and the temple itself. If the PCs wait, they can observe a small Derro trading party approach and trade supplies for gold. The Drow: Outside defense: 1 Drider, 4 Drow Skirmisher, 1 Drow Sergeant, 1 Drow Dark Sniper, 4 Drow Soldiers, 1 Drow Mage . Inside: Drysimma (Drow Priestess of Lolth, Ring of Evasion, Wand of Fear, 2 LAa to use the wand or a spell, extra spells: Toll the Dead, Spirit Guardians, Bless, (will summon a Yochlol, then Spirit Guardians at 5th level, then Wand of Fear and Mass Cure Wounds), 1 Drow Arcane Guard, 3 Drow Skirmisher, 3 Drow Soldiers Ring of Evasion: Srezzrazan the Snake. An old Yuan-Ti artifact/magical creature of unknown provenance (might prove useful in Chapter 9 when dealing with Akuthla). Effects like Ring of Evasion but the PC has colder blood than usual (needs warmer clothing and likes to sit in the sun). Halfaxxan the Grim’s Scepter. Magical scepter of an old Drow Priest. Made from Bone, carved faces, shown in agony. Effects as a Wand of Fear. Using the scepter is unsettling and paranoid visions and dreams are inflicted upon the character. Record every charge used–next time the PC has to save against a fear-like effect, increase the DC by the amount of charges used, then reset the counter to zero. Rooms/Hallways: Southwest: supply room and field kitchen for the drow. Plentiful rations. Eastern and Western sleeping rooms: make-shift sleeping areas. PCs can find random trinkets from the Drow soldiers. Each room has valuables worth 4d12 GP. Eastern/Western Hallways: Laid into the walls in each hallway are three small vestibules (2 ft wide, 1 ft deep), filled with dwarfen bells. The bells are covered in runes and magical in nature. Hitting one of the bells has varied effects: 1D8 Effect of Moradin’s Bells 1-2 Moradin’s Thunder. All non-dwarven creatures roll WIS ST DC-15 or be stunned and deafened for 1 round. 3-4 Moradin’s Light. All non-dwarven creatures roll CON ST DC-15 or be blinded for 2 rounds. 5-6 Moradin’s Rumble. All non-dwarven creatures roll DC-15 STR ST or be proned. 7-8 Moradin’s Wrath. All non-dwarven creatures roll DC-15 WIS ST or be frightened for 2 rounds. Study: personal items of Drysimma. Random spell scrolls of 2nd, 3rd, 4th level. Jewels worth 1000 GP. Mencius: The Inner Sanctum of the Temple is protected by a magical barrier that Drow cannot pass. No magic can pass through the barrier and all active spells are dispelled upon passing. Ranged attacks cannot pass through the magical barrier. Non-Drow can slowly walk through the barrier. It was created via the heroic sacrifice of Durin and his party, fending off the Drow. Their bodies lie in permanent Gentle Repose inside. Touching the bodies requires a successful WIS ability check DC-20 (DC-16 for a lawful good dwarf, a prayer to Moradin will give a +2, PCs may guess that a prayer to Moradin could work, or give them some hints). Inside the Sanctum, no teleportation magic is possible. Mencius (stats of a modified Cambion Warlock of the Fiend, 2 LR, 2 LA for cantrip attacks or 1 LA spell) and several improved Doppelganger to match the party’s size. One Doppelganger will pretend to be bound and captured, so that the PCs suspect their own party member had been replaced earlier. They will try to grapple certain PCs and take on their look to confuse everyone about who to target. They have two Multiattacks +8 with 2d6+6. Mencius is attempting to get the shard from the body of Torgga, who is lying next to Durin. The Doppelgangers will try to protect him as best as possible, confusing the PCs. Once Mencius gets the shard, he will try to fight the PCs but eventually will cross the barrier and plane shift away. If the PCs beat him, so be it–he has a fungal clone of himself prepared (the clone is weaker/twisted). The bodies of they PCs copies are not quite human–they seem to be weird fungal copies and their flesh is grown through with fungus. Durin is carrying is overflowing silver tankard (never-ending beer in social settings) and his sun-forged warhammer (BA to activate light, +2, +1d8 extra radiant damage against undead and fiends). 8.10 Post-Script PCs may or may not get the shard. They can claim Durin’s tankard and the sun-forged hammer. If Durin is resurrected, he will give them the tankard. They also find 2,000 GP, a Robe of Eyes and a Horn of Blasting Mencius will try to send the PCs a message via his dream spell ability. The goal is to gloat for having acquire the shard or to let the PCs know that he is not dead: Dream spell attack by Mencius. If he died, this is to remind the PCs that he is still, in some form, around. If Mencius got away with the shard, this is his way of showing dominance. Dream A: PC awakes in a dream, standing in a room with mirrors surrounding them. At first they only see regular reflections of themselves in the mirror. Once they look closer, they spot a lose flap of skin at their ear in the reflection. If they pull on it, they can take of a while skin flap on their face (without pain, just an odd pulling sensation). Under the flap is clean, white skin. If they keep going, they find Mencius’ face under their own and the reflection in the mirror starts laughing. If the PC punches the mirror, they cut themselves and find a similar phenomenon under the skin of their arm. Dream B: PC has returned home to their loved one. They are having a family. Spouse asks the PCs to help them with something, their child has something on their back. If the PC investigates they find a fist-sized protrusion on the back. They can attempt a Medicine check to investigate. As they do, the protrusion starts to move. If the PC wants to remove it, they find a small version of Mencius’ face growing out of the back, starts laughing and shouting that they will never get rid of him. Mencius will try to insinuate the PCs may be copies themselves, just a failed experiment on the loose. Aren’t their memories more real and fresh after they appear in Bracken? What do they really remember from their time before? He suggests they should cut themselves open to see for themselves. If PCs start Scrying on Mencius at this stage, they have a chance of observing him (roll 1D10): 1–6 he is in his Private Sanctum, 7 he is walking around Helsundburg, 8 He is overseeing the unloading of a river barge, 9 He is meeting with an emissary for Shargak, 10 he is meeting with Knights of the Crimson Heart. He has a magical protection from Andromalion that muffles all sound as if perceiving through water, but the PCs can observe him and glean clues. PCs return to Rumnaheim with the hammer (possibly with Durin and/or Torgga as well). Gilthur welcomes them and throws a celebratory feast for them. Depending on the degree of success (and RP), Gilthur will send dwarfs to the defense of Bracken. Minimum: 40 trained shield-dwarfs. Maximum: 40 trained shield dwarfs, 2 clerics of Moradin, 2 Fists of Moradin (Paladins), 10 Berserkers (barbarians). Osswald and Orin are determined to return to Bracken as quickly as possible–word has arrived that the attack is imminent. There is also a message waiting from Benoit that he wants to talk with the PCs urgently and in person, he has a lead on a ritual to banish Andromalion. If Torrga has been resurrected. They should talk with her to decide what to do with the shard. "],["old-enemies.html", "Chapter 9 Old Enemies 9.1 Overview 9.2 Bracken Under Siege 9.3 Order of the Crimson Heart", " Chapter 9 Old Enemies 9.1 Overview After the retrieval of the fifth shard, either by Mencius or the PCs, Mencius will begin his endgame. His first priority is to reclaim as many of the remaining shards as possible. To that end, he has secretly supported Shargak’s attack on Bracken. He hopes the attack will draw the attention of the PCS and lead them away from Waterdeep. He is planning to kill or capture Benoit and steal the shards. At the same time, the Purple Dragon Knights will also consolidate control over Marsember by arresting Gregor and Max, on suspicion of treason, and temporarily take over the security of the city. The PCs will be asked by the dwarfs to help in the defense of Bracken. At the same time, they will receive a message from Benoit, asking them to Waterdeep to learn about his discovery of a banishment ritual. The PCs will have to choose which path to take. If the PCs decide to defend Bracken, they can organize the city’s defense in Section Bracken Under Siege. The Purple Dragon Knights will attack Benoit and kill him. They will retrieve 1d4: 1 no shards, 2-3 1 shard, 4 2 shards. If the PCs decide to go to Benoit, proceed with Here Come the Purple Dragon Knights. Bracken will be attacked by Shargak and the final outcome depends on the dwarf’s defense. Roll a 1d6 (add +1 if the PCs did well in The Mountains of Madness and the dwarfs of Mirabar supplied a lot of support to Bracken): 1 Bracken is destroyed, the residents killed or captured, 2 the town is partially destroyed, many killed, Bracken never fully recovers; 1D6 Result 1-2 Bracken is destroyed, the residents killed or captured. All friendly NPCs known to the PCs die. 3-4 The town is partially destroyed, many killed, Bracken never fully recovers. At least 2 friendly NPCs known to the PCs die. 5 Bracken repels the attack successfully, but some losses are incurred. The town takes a year to recover. At least one friendly NPC known to the characters dies. Shargak survives but is overthrown by hos own troops and exiled. 6 Bracken routs Shargak’s attack and the Shaman is killed. The city sustain few losses and the victory leads to sustained growth. 9.2 Bracken Under Siege 9.2.1 Si Vis Pacem, Para Bellum The closer the PCs get to Bracken, the more they see abandoned farmsteads, destroyed farmsteads, and refugees on the road. Everyone is scared and is trying to take refuge in Bracken. On arrival, they discover the city changed. Ever since the BMC left, the city has improved under the leadership of the dwarfs. New buildings but also new fortifications. You see a new town militia patrolling (mostly dwarfs). Streets are also full with refugees and scared townsfolk. Hints of preferential treatment for dwarfs are bubbling up. PCs may spot some graffiti, overhear some complaints in a tavern, or see the dwarven militia harass some humans in town for minor infraction on orderliness/cleanliness (e.g., militia are enforcing new health codes in the market square, forcing an old, established human butcher to close their stall). The town is abuzz with worry about the impending attack, but also excitement for the presence of the PCs and the new contingent of Rumnaheim society warriors. This latter fact makes the human population even more worried about the power of the dwarfs. PCs take part in a meeting between the Rumnaheim dwarfs, Orin, Osswald, and Mayor Falin Thurbrook. They should help prepare the town for battle. Here are some suggestions, but players may come up with their own ideas: Basics of the town defenses: Bracken has now a wooden palisade that rings the town, several guard towers, the main South Gate and a second, smaller Eastern Gate. The gates are reinforced. The South Gate is adjacent to a fortified stone barbican. On the Barbican is a mounted ballista (1 action to load, range 120/480 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (3d10) piercing damage). Townguard are 20 dwarfs with sword, shield, crossbows, and chainmail. 50 militia with short bows, spears, leather armor. PCs will do skill checks and accumulate victory points. At least 8 attempts + the mob + the investigation of the missing supplies. Skill checks with a roll over 15 are helpful (+1), over 20 are strong successes (+2), everything under 8 incurs a penalty (-1). Total points, together with the outcomes of the encounters + how many dwarfs from the Rumnaheim society are present, will determine the overall success. Tasks: Repair/finish/reinforce the palisades. Appropriate skill checks: Crafting with carpenter’s tools, Athletics for the manual labor, History for picking strategic spots for reinforcement (or others depending on PC ideas). Train militia members in melee. Skill checks: attack rolls or History for strategy, Persuasion for morale. Train militia members in archery. Skill checks: attack rolls or History for strategy, Persuasion for morale. Reinforce the main gate. Appropriate skill checks: Crafting with carpenter’s tools or stone mason’s tools, Athletics for the manual labor. Prepare fire pits, alchemical conconctions. Skill checks: Crafting with alchemical tools. Set up the healer’s tent on the market square. Skill checks: Medicine. Secure food stores and supplies (e.g., arrows and tar), in case of a longer siege. Investigation, History, Cook’s tools. Scout the surrounding area to anticipate attacks. Skill checks: Survival or Stealth. Set traps outside the walls. Skill checks: Survival or Thieves’s tools. Events: Calm the population (Stop a mob of human looters that are complaining about the dwarfs using this as a pretense for a full take-over). Skill checks: Persuasion or Intimidation or spells. Violence will incur a penalty. Increase bonus and penalty by 1 step. Find a gang of thieves/smugglers that has been stealing from the supply stores. 2 Skill checks: Investigation/Perception, Insight/Intimidation/Persuasion. Increase bonus and penalty by 1 step. Min and max points with 8 tasks and 2 events: -12 to 22. Basic Rumnaheim contingent present (+4), no Rumnaheim society present (-4), elite Rumnaheim society present (+6). -16 to 28 for min-max points. 9.2.2 The Long Night Encounters throughout the night. As long as the healer’s tent is safe, the PCs can get augmented short rests (double the hit die effects). PCs should decide where to allocate dwarfs, militia, and Rumnaheim dwarfs: South Gate, East Gate, Palisade, town patrol, auxiliary (or let players decide other locations) The sun has set, heavy fog rolls through the trees (goblin shamans are casting fog cloud to cover the advance of the troops). 1st wave: hordes of regular goblins attacking the walls. Goblins will shoot arrows and try to climb the walls with grappling hooks. They are also carrying some ladders. Wave ends when the PCs have killed 50 (or whatever is fun) goblins. Use regular Goblins. To simplify arrow attacks by goblins: Every PC in range and on the battlements makes a Dex ST DC-14 (+2/+4 for cover) or take 1d6+2 damage. Use 1-2 saving throws per round. 2nd wave: Goblins and Ogres. If PCs order their troops into battle, kill goblins quicker. Goblin arrow attacks keep coming during this phase. 6 Ogres are carrying a battering ram. 3 are Ogre Battering Rams, 3 are Ogre Chargers. 4 need to be conscious to keep going. The gate has AC-15 and 80 HP. The battering ram has +5 to hit and 4d12+10 damage on a hit. Roughly 3 rounds until the gate breaks. 3rd Wave: When the ogres are stopped, the defenders cheer but suddenly a rock flies over the palisade and destroys a house, killing several civilians. Defenders are shell shocked and frightened. PCs should try and uplift their morale by speech and acts (e.g., leading a sortie against the catapult). The fog lifts a bit and the PCs can spot a catapult on a small hill outside of town, protected by ogres. The catapult will take 5 rounds to breach the palisade. On the way to the catapult, PCs will be blocked by 20 Goblin Worg Riders. The catapult itself is protected by 4 Ogre Berserkers, 2 Ogre Hurlers, 1 Ogre Shaman, 1 Ogre King. Catapult has AC-12 and 60 HP. 4th Wave/Event: A fire breaks out inside the wall, close to the supply storage. PCs need to decide if they go themselves and help out out the fire and how many of the 20 auxiliary to send. If PCs go, they need to: rescue civilians, douse flames, find tracks of bugbears. Let PCs use abilities and ideas to rescue civilians and douse flames. Possible skill checks: Athletics, Persuasion, Medicine (to treat burns) (+2 victory points). To spot the tracks and signs of bugbears, do perception and/or survival checks DC-15 (there are non-human tracks), DC-17 (3 bugbear stalkers are identified). If the PCs went to deal with the flames, depending on how many auxiliary are left, healer’s tent gets destroyed (-4 victory points). If the storage gets destroyed -2 victory points. A wave of Goblins attacks the palisade at the same time. Final wave: Goblins and ogres attack the walls (use regular goblin and ogre stat blocks). Siege weapon on the barbican is being attacked by elite goblin warriors on wyverns. Shargak also appears on a large wyvern. First, 4 Wyvern with 4 goblin archers (use Hobgoblin Archer statblock). Shargak arrives mid-fight. Shargak uses the stat block of an Archdruid and has a legendary action for spellcasting and is riding an Ancient Wyvern named Rizurrg. Determine the final outcome: Award points for wave 1: 50 goblins killed in less than 5 rounds (+2) Award points for wave 2: Gate was breached (-4), the palisade was destroyed (-8), catapult destroyed (+2) Award points for the fire: quick help with the fire (+2), if the fire burns down the storage (-2), healer’s tent destroyed (-4) Award extra points for the distribution of troops: protection of the Western Gate (+2) Award points for final fight: quick/impressive end to Shargak: +4 points, a hero or NPC falls (-4) Final outcome: total range is -34 to 40, &lt;0 most known NPCs die and the town has to be abandoned, 1–20 the town survives, 1 NPC dies, 20\\(+\\) minimal casualties, all NPCs survive. Figure 9.1: The Defense of Bracken. Source: Homemade 9.3 Order of the Crimson Heart The plan of the Purple Dragon Knights is as follows: PDK leadership has been led to believe that the Silversword family is preparing a coup. The PDK are arresting Gregor and Max in Marsember, while a strike team is positioned in Waterdeep to take Benoit. The PDK have reached out to the authorities in Waterdeep to secured diplomatic support. The authorities of Waterdeep will allow the PDK to arrest benoit. The strike team arrives at the mansion, while the city guard is cordoning off the surrounding area. Purple Dragon Knights have split up into two teams: 4 Knights, CR 3 (2X) 2 Blackguards, CR 8 (2X) 1 Evoker, CR 9 (2X) 1 Cult High Priest of Asmodeus, CR 6 (2X) They enter the mansion and then start attacking everyone inside. The two teams will try to advance to the top level and enter the demi-plane. There, they will split up into two teams to pursue Benoit and the shards. Once they have apprehended or killed Benoit and secured the shards, they will planeshift away (the Evoker has a scroll/spell). Here is way of handling the whole assault via a skill challenge: When approaching the mansion, streets are blocked by city guards. PCs need to negotiate passage or push through. The guards only know that there is a diplomatic incident and civilians need to stay away. Diplomacy, Intimidation or Stealth DC 14. Use of a spell (3rd level or higher Advantage, below +2) or class resource gives advantage. PCs need to make four checks, need two successes to proceed. Failure increases the threat counter by 1. When the PCs arrive at the mansion, the front door is open and Dietrich lies in the entry hall, mortally wounded. He is 1 death save away from death. Bodies of knights are strewn about. DC 11 History reminds the PCs that these are Purple Dragon Knights from Cormyr. Healing spell or DC-15 Medicine check to safe Dietrich. Stopping to help him, increases the threat counter by 1. Getting to the 4th floor. Three checks total, no PC more than once. DC 18. 2 successes needed. On a failure, threat counter increases by 1. Goal is to avoid the haywire magical traps across all four floors (arcana, acrobatics, athletics, thieves’ tools, crafting, dispel magic). For every failed roll, the PC loses 1/4 of their health. Upstairs they find more evidence of a fight: dead bodies, destroyed constructs, fire damage–all the way up to the top floor. The top floor is a scene of total destruction and the portal to the demi-plane stands open. When entering the demi-plane, the PCs see tracks of blood of a single person leading to Benoit’s study, followed by tracks of six heavily armed individuals and 2 lightly armored individuals. Similar tracks lead to the vault. PCS need to decide to go after Benoit (who is unconscious when the PCs arrive and about to be killed) or the shards. Going after Benoit: Threat counter automatically increases by 2. PCs need to confront a PDK strike team and save Benoit. Can use attacks, spells, grappling, intimidation, deception. DC 18, need 4 successes vs. 3 failures. Each failure, PC loses 1/4 of their health. Then a healing spell of Medicine check DC-15. Going after the shards: Benoit dies. PCs need to confront a PDK strike team. Can use attacks, spells, grappling, intimidation, deception. DC 18, need 4 successes vs. 3 failures. Each failure, PC loses 1/4 of their health. Failing the challenge increases the threat level by 2. Splitting up: They have to do both skill challenges, but start with an automatic loss in each. Final confrontation: Stop the PDK leader from absconding with the shards. Final skill challenge. Each PC has to use two different abilities. DC is determined by the current threat level. 8 skill checks, final outcome is determined by the number of successes. THREAT LEVEL DC 0–2 16 3–5 18 6–7 20 NUMBER OF SUCCESSES OUTCOME 0–2 PDKs flee with both shards. 3–4 PDKs flee with 1 shard. 5–8 PDKS fail to acquire any shards. If Benoit dies, Dietrich can fill the PCs in on the story of the Lost City of Tzz’a and Paimoraxxas. PCs can learn that the PDK have received official diplomatic right to apprehend Benoit. Him and Gregor are accused of planning a coup in Cormyr. PDK apprehend Gregor, take over security in Marsember. Maximiellene is on the run. The Legend of the Lost City of Tzz’a: He has uncovered some tales about the Lost City of Tzz’a. The City of Tzz’a was an ancient city state in the Calim Desert (today’s Calimshan), populated by serpentfolk (also known as Yuan-Ti). The city was embroiled in some religious schism between the main cult of Sseth and some new sect, which Benoit believes to be an earlier incarnation of the Church of Andromalion (the use of music and art, the theme of change and beauty). Benoit has learned that the First Sorcerer-Priest of Tzz’a had developed a plan of banishing Andromalion from the material plane with the help of a devil: Paimoraxxas. Paimoraxxas may know more and Benoit has found a way of contacting him with a summoning ritual. They city was destroyed by some unknown disease and lost to history–nobody knows its actual location anymore (somewhere in the Calim desert). Treasure hunters have been after it, but nobody has found it. Figure 9.2: benoit’s Demiplane.

PCs get the option to contact a devil for more information about a banishment ritual. Benoit left instructions on how to conjure the devil. Devil can offer information on where to find the secrets of banishment in exchange for recovering an artifact (a lich’s phylactery (a canopic jar with a snake head)–the soul was promised but the sorcerer-priest became a lich to avoid her fate). The devil knows of Andromalion and how he feeds on souls. He offered the sorcerer-priest a magical mirror plus knowledge on how to beat Andromalion but the sorcerer was not willing to make the necessary sacrifice. The city was destroyed and the sorcerer-priest became a lich to avoid their soul being sucked to hell. Devil wants the phylactery, makes PCs sign an elaborate contract. Mirror + sacrifice to protect against charm (secret for each pc), glass shards need to be plunged into Andromalion’s skin 10.2 A Deal With the Devil Players make a deal with the devil Paimoraxxas (a Paeliryon, Dragonix II): information about Andromalion in exchange for the recovery of an artifact–a lich’s phylactery (a canopic jar with a snake head). Excursion to an old city that was destroyed by Andromalion 2,000 years ago. Learn about the summoning and banishment. In the city they have to battle a Lich. Paimoraxxas, The Lord-Glutton of the Fetid Feast, Curatorio of the Endless Gallery, and Third Un-Cardinal of the Church of Mammon, Count of Minauros the Third Layer of Hell. Fat, floating, bald, wears silken robes that are too small, heavy, be-jeweled rings, his legs are tiny and atrophied (think: Baron Harkonnen). Summoning ritual: Rotting corpse of a two-headed goat Expensive spoiled wine (250 GP at least) Circle of summoning, silver dust (1000 GP), Arcana check DC-15 (determines the safety of the circle) Infernal chant, provided by Benoit’s notes. PCs need to bring a goblet of turned goat’s milk, fill it with blood of a living creature (total of 400 HP from the PCs, other humans or animals). 7 summoners are needed, they all drink from the cup and then begin the chant. Performance, Arcana, or Religion skill checks DC-15, count successes. The more successes, the better the ritual works. The ritual summons him for 1 hour, the circle protects the PCs from Paimoraxxas. Circle is broken if the PCs attack the devil. The ritual confers to no power over the devil, the PCs still need to strike a bargain. Bargain: Paimoraxxas promises them how to acquire the banishment ritual in exchange for the phylactery (including the soul) of the Sorcerer-Priestess Akutl’ah. They have to sign an infernal contract. He can tell them the ritual has three parts: looking into a magical mirror to protect oneself from Andromalion’s charm, a blessing of the shards to weaken Andromalion. Then you have to force Andromalion to reveal its true form–at the moment of death, activate the shards with the banishment word. He will share the magical banishment word after they hand over the phylactery. Can also provide a bit of background on Andromalion. The contract specifies the exchange of the lich’ soul for the banishment ritual. There is no time-limit (PCs may choose to never complete the bargain). Paimoraxxas is too arrogant to think Akutl’ah may offer her own deal to the PCs. The contract has fine-print on aggressive action against the devil–if they attack him before or 30 days after the deal is concluded, he will come after them and take their souls. If the PCs simply fail to complete the deal, he will get angry and plan is revenge, but will have no contractual power over the PCs. You can find the mirror and the scroll with the blessing ritual with Sorcerer-Priestess Akutl’ah. Paimoraxxas worked with her to develop the ritual. She failed to complete the banishment, her city was lost. He believes she entombed herself in the temple for protection and turned herself into a lich to avoid surrendering her soul to me. He can give the PCs the rough location of the lost city. He can point them to the desert oasis Kurun in the Calim Desert. 10.3 The Heat of the Desert PCs have to travel to Calimshan by ship. Their destination is Kurun, the desert oasis. Kurun is a remote outpost in the desolate part of the Calim desert. It is run by a group of merchants. Oasis options: Citrus orchard. Merchant guesthouse. Caravanserei. Low quality tavern. Temple of Ilmater (Martyrdom and suffering). Waterhole. Hirelings are available: caravan guards, guides. Rumors in Kurun.

[5] There are lost ruins in the Northeast, full of magical treasures, but they are haunted by ghosts (P). [6] A week ago a group of foreigners came through. They said they were archaeologists looking for some lost ruins. They seemed a bit strange (never blinked). [7] There is a djinn that lives in the desert that will fulfill a wish (F).

No teleportation in and out of the temple. Entrance door can be opened via Knock upcast to 5th level. Massive violence can also open it. Otherwise there is a puzzle: A locked metal door blocks the entrance. Show the players Handout A when they approach it. The metallic frame surrounding the door bears twelve 6” square plates, each one etched with an elongated serpent. Four tiles are placed in the lintel and four are on either side of the door. Inspection of the tiles reveals they can be spun, allowing the serpent on each to face either towards the door, away from it, looking up or looking down. Spinning the tiles to orient the serpents’ facing produces different effects as in- dicated on the table on page 6. Lacking a keyhole, the door cannot be picked. The whole level is dark, smells stale. A2 First room: Dead Yuan-Ti on the floor, 4 Yuan-Ti statues in the corners, with ruby eyes. No visible signs of violence. Poisoned Tempest trap. If someone pries the gems from the statues, stone doors seal the room and the trap begins. A3 If someone leaves the entrance room and steps into the hallway the next trap is triggered, similar to The Path of Blades: 3 parts and the final rune. Part 1: Spears attack when someone passes through, first entrance + every turn in the area a PC gets targeted with 2 attacks at +10, 3d10 piercing + DC-15 CON ST or the PC’s movement is reduced to 5 ft. A4 Part 2: Crushing stones, wall, ceiling and floor stones move up and down, crushing PCs, DC-15 DEX ST or 3d10 bludgeoning damage and knocked prone. A5 Part 3: fiery blast, DC-15 DEX ST or 7d6 fire damage and a Rune of Fear above the hole in the ground. DC-15 WIS ST or the PC has to use their reaction and move back away from the rune, can use another action later and try to repeat the saving throw. Pyramid Level 2 Level 2 B1 Entrance area. Hear noises coming from B3 B3 Yuan-Ti guards at entrance: appear first in human form and talk with the PCs (illusion via the Seeming spell), pretend that one is injured and needs help, try to draw them to the others, they give their names as Anne de Griis (human, red hair) and Gereon de Griis (blackbearded man), explorers from Amn. They say they were part of an exploration party, were injured by traps but found something amazing but their third brother Michel de is severely injured further down. Ask the PCs for help. If pressed about the Yuan-Ti, they will say that they were hired by the others (gave the names of Ilfan Ormaz), they were weird and abanonded the siblings when the trap sprung. In truth, they are 1 Yuan-Ti Pitmaster, 1 Yuan-Ti Malison. Yuan-Ti Exploration party: 1 Yuan-Ti Anathema, 1 Yuan-Ti Mind Whisperer, 1 Yuan-Ti Abomination, 1 Yuan-Ti Malison. B8 Central room: likely ambush by the exploration party. Room contains a large snake Iron Maiden. Used to perform the transformation ritual. If a PC is locked into the statue, the spike start the blood draining that feeds the ritual. Each round, the draining causes 2d6 piercing and 2d6 necrotic damage. A PC inside the apparatus can try to escape with a STR DC-20 check or a DC-15 lock-picking check. Roll a D100: 1-20 mindless broodguard, 21–90 Pureblood (stats shift, abilities, neutral evil alignment), 91–95 Yuan-Ti Abomination, 96-100 death but resurrection returns you in one of the other forms.

Burial nooks: sarcophagi of old Serpentfolk priests, each contains jewels worth 1000 GP, old robes (worth 500 GP), and 1 snake key each. B4 Southwestern, square room: Dozens of canopic jars, filled with snake guts. If a PC digs through them, a horrid smell comes out and causes 1 level of exhaustion, but they can find an Amulet of Health B2 Room right to the south, depicts the rule of the serpent priests and their human sacrifices + transformation of human into snake abominations. Secret Exit, magic covers the door: DC-20 perception check to notice the door. Magically sealed. 7 hidden key slits, and an indention for a hand and a little prong to draw blood, only serpent-blooded can actually open the door: force a living Yuan-Ti, transform into a snake (Druid wildshape), have a PC become a Yuan-Ti Pureblood / Abomination in the snakewell.

C14 Empty. Meeting the Lich: PCs can negotiate with the sorcerer-priest-lich for information about the ritual of banishment and the mirror but lich will protect the Phylactery. The lich is interested in outside visitors and, at times, also confused and insane. May think of the PCs as a tool to escape the temple. Lich also knows the word of banishment, but failing to deliver the phylactery draws the ire of Paimoraxxas. The lich developed the banishment ritual with the help of Paimoraxxas, but her plan was foiled by traitors. She was trapped inside the temple. To avoid her soul being surrendered, she turned herself into a lich. The lich would like to leave and for that an enchantment on the pyramids top has to be broken (the top of the pyramid is made from a dark metal). Lich can offer the Word of Banishment and + the magical treasure from the vault. PCs can either try to steal the phylactery and escape before the Lich kills them or make a deal with the Lich, but that will bring the wrath of Paimoraxxas. Lich only speaks Yuan-Ti and Infernal. Akuthla is a LevelUp Lich. 10.7 Post-Script The Word of Banishment is Sseesssumela’hap. Roughly means `Devour’ → A gigantic ghost serpent will appear and devour Andromalion. If the PCs betray the promise to Paimoraxxas, the devil will intervene in the final battle against the party. Imposes Disadvanatge on key rolls.

The city is preparing for the festivities of the Midsummer celebration. Max Silversword went underground and has made a deal with the Sewer Rats for protection. She can contact the PCs to get them into the city. The Sewer Rats can provide the PCs with some limited mobility option within the city through the sewer system. Mencius has poisoned the whole city with Andromalion’s Blessing by putting the shipment from Flowerdale into the Aqueduct supplying Helsundburg with fresh water. Optional: the PCs may try to stop some of the poisoing by fighting Knights of the Crimson Heart at the Aqueduct. The big Midsummer celebration consists of 8 processions to the central square of the gods. Each procession is organized by different city groups (5 processions from neighborhood associations, the Spice merchant Guild, School of the Arts, the Fellowship of the Pious). Each procession is a big March that includes effigies and masked dancers. The city streets are lined with spectators in costumes. All the processions meet at the central square in the Temple Quarter. There is a main stage with representatives of the major religions, normally ready to lead ceremonies. Mencius will take over this part. Benoit will be there too and try to free Gregor and other allies. 11.3 Mencius’ Plan Mencius will use however many shards in his possession to summon a reflection of Andromalion via the Sunharp in the city’s main temple. The processions are a distraction. Mencius has taken over the main temple building with the help of the Order of the Crimson Heart. When all the processions reach the central square, Andromalion will appear above the main temple and begin his Hypnosis of the main population, while Mencius and his fellow cultists secure the area against any intervention by outsiders. Without intervention, Andromalion will charm the nearly the whole population, which has been weakened by the drugs. People will start dancing into ecstasy and eventually surrender their souls to Andromalion, wiping out the city’s population. 11.4 Summoning and Banishment If Andromalion was summoned with all five shards, they start with full immunity to all damage. For 1 missing shard, they lack two immunities, for 2 missing shards, they lack 3 immunities, for 3 missing shards, they lack 4 immunities (determined randomly, physical damage always has to be be magical). PCs can become immune to Andromalion’s Charm Aura by using the magical mirror from the Lost City of T’zza. To do so, they need to look into the mirror and see a true reflection of themselves. Players should discuss their PCs deepest flaws or insecurities. Andromalion preys on insecurities, by taking an honest look at themselves, the PCs will be steeled against any attempt to prey on them. Andromalion possess immunities and regenerates 20 HP every round. Plunging a shard into their skin removes another damage immunity and reduces the regeneration by 5 points (the third shard removes two immunities). Roll for damage types: 1D20 Damage Type 1-2 Acid 3 Bludgeoning 4-5 Cold 6-7 Fire 8-9 Force 10-11 Lightning 12 Necrotic 13 Piercing 14-15 Poison 16-17 Psychic 18 Radiant 19 Slashing 20 Thunder Banishment: PCs need to reveal Andromalion’s true form, weaken him, and then speak the Word of Banishment. Initial form is the traditional depiction of Andromalion: glorious, beautiful, butterfly wings of rainbow-colored light, floating in the air. When that form is reduced to 0 HP and fails 3 death saving throws, Andromalion’s true form is revealed. True form has to be reduced to less than 0 HP as well, then PCs have the chance to speak the Word of Banishment. A spellcaster PC can try a spellcasting check. If they sacrifice two attribute points, they gain +1, if they permanently sacrifice 10 HP, they gain +1 on the roll. They can gain a max of +5 on a single roll. If they sacrifice their life, they gain Advantage on the roll. The DC is 25. They have to speak the word successfully 3 times before Andromalion reaches \\(&gt;\\) 0 HP. In its true form, Andromalion does not go unconscious at 0 HP. Track negative HP. While below 0 HP, they regenerate 10 HP per round. This means there is a small window of opportunity to complete the Banishment. When the Banishment hits, a modified Contingency triggers a 20d6 Psychic Scream spell. Allow PCs a counterspell attempt. 11.5 The Final Battle Figure 11.1: The Temple. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Figure 11.2: The Courtyard. Source: 2-Minute Tabletop Mencius, Vraxa Redstar, 6 Purple Dragon Knights are protecting the main stage. Mencius has 2 shards. Andromalion will at first ignore the PCs and collect souls of bystanders each round. They use Legendary Actions for Mass Hypnotic Pattern and main Actions for Soulrend. Once the PCs attack Andromalion and reduce them by 25% of their HP, they will start to attack the party. Bystanders will complicate the surroundings.

Additional waves of Knights/Thugs and Archers. Environmental Hazards: Andromalion’s presence will warp the environment, spots of difficult terrain.
